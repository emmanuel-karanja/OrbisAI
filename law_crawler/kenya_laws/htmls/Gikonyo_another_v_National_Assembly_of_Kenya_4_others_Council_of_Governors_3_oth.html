                The petitioners challenged the National Government Constituencies Development Fund Act, 2015, arguing it violated constitutional principles of devolution, separation of powers, and prudent financial management. They claimed the Act improperly involved Members of Parliament in fund oversight, duplicated county government functions, and bypassed Senate consultation. The High Court found the Act unconstitutional, holding that it undermined devolution by intruding into county functions, created inefficiency through duplication, and violated the doctrine of separation of powers by allowing MPs to oversee projects. The Court also ruled the Act breached Articles 201 and 205 by failing to ensure prudent financial management and bypassing Senate consultation.

                The petitioners filed a constitutional petition challenging the constitutionality of the National Government Constituencies Development Fund Act, 2015 (the 2015 Act/the Act). The Act was enacted to replace the Constituencies Development Fund Act, 2013, which had been declared unconstitutional. The petitioners argued that the 2015 Act violated several constitutional principles, including the doctrine of separation of powers, the principle of devolution, and prudent management of public finance.
               </span>
               <span class="akn-p">
                The petitioners contend that the 2015 Act allowed for the allocation of funds to the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NGCDF) prior to the vertical division of revenue between the National and county Governments. They alleged that the practice contravenes articles 201 and 203 of the Constitution, which outlined principles of public finance. The petitioners also asserted that the Act improperly involves Members of Parliament in the administration of public funds, undermining the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers and creating conflicts between different levels of government.
               </span>
               <span class="akn-p">
                Additionally, the petitioners argued that the Act duplicated functions assigned to county governments under the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution, resulting in inefficient use of public resources and confusion in governance structures.

                 Under article 259 of the Constitution, the court was enjoined to interpret the Constitution in a manner that promotes its purposes, values and principles. The general presumption was that Acts of Parliament were enacted in conformity with the Constitution. The provisions of the Constitution must be read as an integrated whole, without any one particular provision destroying the other but each sustaining the other. Courts must be a liberal approach that promoted the rule of law and had jurisprudential value that must take into account the spirit of the Constitution.

                 The 2022 and 2023 amendments, several sections of the National Government Constituencies Development Fund Act (the Act) were deleted and repealed. Sections 15(4), 19, 43(2)(e), 53 were deleted, repealed or substituted by the 2023 Act. The challenge to those provisions in the petition was moot. however, there was still a raging dispute calling for adjudication on the remainder of the Act. The 2022 and 2023 amendments to the 2015 Act did not negate the substratum of the entire petition.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 Devolution was a key cornerstone in the architecture of the Constitution. The Constitution called for optimal utilization of public resources. Sustainable development was a national value and principle under article 10 of the Constituion. So much so that the framers of the Constitution abhorred wastage of government resources through multiplication of delivery channels.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 The creation of the constituency as a service delivery unit under the Act led to multiple channels of funding and implementation of projects, wastage of public resources and lack of clarity. All those undermined the principle of devolution and the architecture of the Constitution on the two levels of government, separation of powers and the primary oversight role of Parliament.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 The basic structure doctrine was not applicable in Kenya. The challenge to the Act founded upon violation of the doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution failed.

                <li class="akn-li">
                 Parliament as a legislative arm of government under the Constitution consists of the Senate and the National Assembly. The legislative remit of the National Assembly fell under the National Government in the vertical division of powers between the National Government and the county governments. That was evident from article 95 of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 The nature of the projects set out in the Act as amended in 2022 and 2023 included education bursary schemes, education days, teaching and learning activities and other learners’ social support programmes; climate change mitigation activities including afforestation, reafforestation, grassroot sensitization and tree seedling production. Section 8 of the Act created an emergency reserve equivalent to 5% which shall remain unallocated and available for emergencies that may occur within the Constituency. This Emergency Reserve was akin, in all respects and aspects to the County Emergency Funds and the Contingency Fund created under the Contingency and County Emergency Funds Act (CCEF Act). The object of the Act was to ensure that the Contingencies Fund, and the County Emergency Funds were managed and operated by the National Government and the county governments respectively as contemplated by article 208(2) of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 Part 3 of the CCEF Act under section 10(2) provides for the purpose of the emergency fund being to enable payments to be made in respect of a county when an urgent and unforeseen need for expenditure arises for which there was no specific legislative authority. The fund at the county level was administered by the county government secretary while at the National Government level, it was administered by the Treasury under the management of the Cabinet Secretary responsible for matters relating to Finance. The emergency reserve was a replica of the above two other funds established by statute and consequently, the 2015 Act created a duplication of activities and or wastage of resources which could alternatively be assigned to the county governments as provided in article 186(3) of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 It was important to have clarity about which level of government was empowered to do what. That avoided confusion and duplication of mandates and responsibilities, and allowed for proper accountability to citizens in respect of service delivery. When there was no clarity, blame could easily be shifted from one sphere of government to the other. The Fund had the potential of creating confusion in the implementation of projects by the two levels of government. Duplication of funding for the same project was inevitable leading to wastage of scarce public resources. The Fund fostered a state of lack of clarity as to which level of government was responsible for which particular project thereby compromising accountability.

                <li class="akn-li">
                 The doctrine of separation of powers was a key organizational framework for governance under the 2010 constitutional Scheme. The doctrine was a fundamental principle of law that required the three arms of government to remain separate, and that one arm of government should not usurp functions belonging to another arm. Allowing Legislators any role, even a merely ceremonial role in discharging a mandate that belongs to the executive branch at either the national or the county level, would promote conflict of interest and compromise their oversight role.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 Section 15 (4) of the 2015 Act provided for the approval of members of the NGCDF Board by the National Assembly. Section 19 provided for the role of the National Assembly in considering petitions for removal of members of the NGCDF Board while section 43 (1) (4) &amp; (6) and (9) provided for the establishment of the NGCDF Committee for every constituency, approval of the same by the National Assembly and tied the meeting of the Committee to the parliamentary election or by election timelines. Section 15(4) above had since been repealed vide an amendment to the 2023 Amendment Act. However, the National Assembly, under section 15(1)(e), had retained the role of approving members of the Board appointed by the Cabinet Secretary on recommendations of the Public Service Commission. Under section 43(4) and (5), the names of the seven persons of the NGCDF Committee shall be submitted to the National Assembly for approval before appointment and gazettement by the Board.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 Whereas the role of the National Assembly in the two scenarios under sections 15 (1) (e) and 43 (4) and (5) of the Act could safely be said to be oversight role, the catch was in section 43(9) which was clear that the Fund Account Manager who was the holder of the purse to the Fund, seconded by the Board to the Constituency shall be the custodian of all records and equipment of the Constituency during the term of Parliament and during transition occasioned by general election or a by election. That meant that the term of the Fund Account Manager was tied to the term of Parliament which was five years or in the case of a by election. The Member of the National Assembly remained in the shadows of the Fund, controlling its operations, however remotely, at the constituency level.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 Section 53 of the 2015 Act provided for the establishment of a Constituency Oversight Committee for projects under the Act which comprised the constituency Member of Parliament as well as other members. Section 53 (3) involved the Constituency Member of Parliament as the member of the Oversight Committee in mobilizing, sensitizing and soliciting views, opinions and proposals from the public. The entire section 53 of the Act was deleted as a whole in the 2023 legislative amendments and therefore any challenge to the same was moot.

                <li class="akn-li">
                 Article 1(4) of the Constitution established the National and county Governments as two distinct levels of government, each deriving its power directly from the Constitution itself. The county government, as outlined in Article 1, did not receive its authority from the National Government but rather from the people of Kenya and the Constitution. That framework positions both levels of government as equals, with neither being subordinate to the other. That said, the National and county Governments were separate yet interconnected entities, required to engage in consultations and cooperation as mandated under articles 6(2) and 189 of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 As long as the Fund, as established, involved aspects of service delivery, however well intended, had the effect of creating structures that were incompatible with the nature of the distribution of functions between the two levels of government.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 Article 95 of the Constitution provides for the roles of the National Assembly. Article 95 did not grant the National Assembly the power to implement projects in the constituency as a service delivery unit. The mandate of members of the National Assembly was to represent, legislate and oversight the national revenue and its expenditure. Accordingly, by creating a Fund that is administered by the constituency, which was a unit of political representation for legislative and oversight roles, however far removed, the Member of the National Assembly may be, in the management and administration of the Fund, ran afoul the doctrine of separation of powers.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 Under section 27 of the Act, the constituency committee was charged with the task of deliberating on project proposals from all wards in the constituency and any other project that may be beneficial to the constituency. The committee was also required to consider the constituency strategic plan and identify a list of priority projects to be submitted to the Board. The funding of projects was provided for under section 25 of the Act. The projects were then implemented by the project management committee, pursuant to section 36. Section 54 provided that the provisions of the Act were complimentary to any other development efforts by the National Government or any other agency. It further provided that nothing in the Act shall be taken or interpreted to mean that an area may be excluded from any other development programmes. No area of development was out of the reach of this Fund under the Act and could directly encroach even on the functions of the county governments under the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 Projects under the Act may include those undertaken by both the National and county Governments. Accordingly, given the governments at both levels also budget for all their functions, programmes and projects, allocating money to the Fund leads to double financing of the same functional areas. That undermines the fiscal efficiency imperative that eliminates wastages in service delivery. Duplication of projects and programmes even if intended for the public good, would inevitably result in wastage or abuse of public funds allocated for the same. In such circumstances, fiscal reporting could not be clear.
                </li>
                <li class="akn-li">
                 The Act provided for conceptualization, funding and implementation of projects within constituencies. Under section 54, no area was out of the reach of the Act and projects thereunder may extend to functions of both the National and county Governments. The Fund had the potential of creating confusion in the implementation of projects by the two levels of government and to duplicate funding for the same projects leading to wastage of scarce public resources and compromising accountability. The 2015 Act, notwithstanding the 2022 and 2023 amendments, violated the constitutional principles of public finance.

                 Under article 216 of the Constitution, the principal function of the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) was to make recommendations concerning the basis for the equitable sharing of revenue raised by the National Government, between the National and county Governments and among the county governments. The recommendations by the CRA on the formula for equitable sharing of nationally raised revenue between the National and county Governments was not obtained. However, under article 205, the making of the recommendations by CRA on the proposals was at its discretion. Nevertheless, the National Assembly was required to submit the proposals to the CRA for consideration.

                 Article 109(3) and (4) of the Constitution clarified when a bill, of the nature of the dispute now before us, should originate from either House of Parliament or when there should be concurrence of both Houses. The impugned Act created an anomalous executive-based- function at the constituency wedged somewhere between the National Government and County Governments. The Fund distorted the devolved structure of government and created structures that were incompatible with the nature of the distribution of functions between the two levels of government. The enactment of the statute without concurrence of the Senate ran counter to article 193 of the Constitution.

                 A division of revenue act provided for the equitable division of revenue raised nationally between the two levels of government in a given financial year. Accordingly, even if the Act in question had been in existence at the time of filing the petition, which it was not, the same was for the financial year 2016/2017 and lapsed by effluxion of time.

                 The Fund had been in operation since 2003. Its centrality and the value of its programmes to the local communities across 290 constituencies could not be gainsaid. There were short-term, medium-term and long-term projects already being implemented by the Fund. Moreover, the life span of the projects was not necessarily pegged to the financial year. The Fund had employees and may have contracts with third parties. At the time of the instant judgment, Kenya was in the middle of the current financial year and funds may have been allocated for ongoing projects. Despite the finding that the 2015 Act as last amended in 2023 was unconstitutional, it would not be in the interest of the nation or of the cause of justice to bring it to an abrupt closure. The principle of justiciability prohibited the court from entertaining hypothetical or academic issues or engage in abstract arguments. The Division of Revenue Act having lapsed at the end of the financial year in question, there was no live issue for determination by the court. The matter was not justiciable. The impugned Act and Fund established thereunder and its programmes ceased to operate at the stroke of midnight on June 30, 2026.

                 The time was ripe for the people of Kenya to appreciate that a constituency was not a service delivery unit but of representation and that the role of the Member of the National Assembly must remain that of representation, legislating and oversight as per article 95 of the Constitution. Funds had been allocated in the current financial year to the projects under the Fund. Extending the Fund beyond the current financial year would unreasonably perpetuate the unconstitutionality of the Act. The 2015 Act and the Fund cease to operate on June 30, 2025, the end of the current financial year.

                  According to this witness, although the Act sought to redress the issues raised by the High Court when it declared the 2013 Act unconstitutional in Pet. 71 of 2013, it remains unconstitutional for the following reasons: Firstly, that members of the National Assembly who have a vested interest in ensuring that more money goes to the national government from which the Fund gets a percentage, may compromise their objectivity, which may lead to a vertical division of revenue that reduces the share of county governments. The report states that contrary to the requirement under Article 201, the Act lacks clarity in how the national government’s portion of revenue will be shared between the Fund as an agency of the national government and other departments of the national government.

                  Secondly, that given that the national government must budget for all its functional areas, allocating money to the Fund leads to double financing of the same functional areas. Both agencies may fail to provide the service and keep passing the responsibility to each other. Additionally, that accountability may be compromised since both agencies may present to the public the same project claiming credit for the same. Further, that the Fund leads to wasteful duplication of roles and structures, resulting in imprudent and irresponsible use of public money.

                  Thirdly, that the projects to be financed by the Fund are not specifically identified in the Act which uses broad terminology to describe allowable projects. Dr. Kangu further stated that the Fund has the effect of transforming the constituency into a third level of government contrary to constitutional provisions. He agreed with the High Court that a constituency is a unit of representation for electing a member of the National Assembly, and not a third level of government with infrastructural development functions; a constituency forms part of a county territory, as such attempts to implement infrastructure development projects in the constituency financed by the national government through the Fund would interfere with the functions of the county government.

                  Fourthly, that even if the Act provides that projects to be financed thereunder are to be in respect of national government functions, there is no clarity to ensure that the projects do not intrude into the functional areas of the county governments. Lastly, that the Act establishes an emergency fund in total disregard of the fact that the emergency functional area is a concurrent function of both the national and county governments.

                  The report further states that one of the objectives of devolution is to allow provision of proximate services to the grassroots and allow the people to participate in governance and decision making. He referred to Article 6(3) which requires every national state organ to ensure reasonable access to its services in all parts of the republic and article 176(2) under which county governments have decentralized their functions at the subcounty level which is equivalent to the constituency, the ward and village levels. He stated that the Act creates a multiplicity of unnecessary structures to manage the Fund and projects and that these structures are parallel to both national and county projects. Relying on para 121 of the decision in Pet. 71 of 2013, he stated that national and county governments have decentralized their functions and provision of services.

                  respondent also called an expert witness, Dr. Charles Oyaya who produced a report dated July 19, 2017 and a supplementary report filed on October 5, 2017. His two reports can be broadly summarized as follows: That the challenges by the petitioners to the Act most of which relate to the concurrent mandates between national and county governments are practically transitional in nature. As such, they should not form grounds for the entire abrogation of the Act. On whether the design and operations of the Fund leads to a usurpation by the legislature of the essential function of another branch leading to a removal of checks and balances, he opined that the Act greatly delimits the role of MPs in regards to overall governance, management and administration of the Fund. MPs are relegated to more of an advisory position tasked with assisting community mobilization and project oversight.

                  He stated that the formal functions of MPs in relation to the Act relate mostly to legislative functions. He gave the example of the functions of the Select Committee established under Section 50 to examine legislative proposals; oversight by the Constituency Oversight Committee established under section 53; representation and constituency service explaining the membership in the constituency development committee established under Section 43, of two persons nominated by the constituency office. His view is that while this arguably constitutes a breach of separation of powers, what requires probing is whether this negates the checks and balances. He concludes that in the overall purpose, structures and procedures of the Act, the extent of separation of powers seems sustainable.

                     These principles are not new. They also apply to the construction of statutes. There are other important principles which apply to the construction of statues which, in my view, also apply to the construction of a Constitution such as presumption against absurdity – meaning that a court should avoid a construction that produces an absurd result; the presumption against unworkable or impracticable result - meaning that a court should find against a construction which produces unworkable or impracticable result; presumption against anomalous or illogical result, - meaning that a court should find against a construction that creates an anomaly or otherwise produces an irrational or illogical result and the presumption against artificial result – meaning that a court should find against a construction that produces artificial result and, lastly, the principle that the law should serve public interest –meaning that the court should strive to avoid adopting a construction which is in any way adverse to public interest, economic, social and political or otherwise………… The court as an independent arbiter of the

                     It is a sound principle of constitutional construction that, if possible, a legislation should receive such a construction as will make it operative and not inoperative…there is a presumption of constitutionality of a legislation, save where a clawback or exclusion clause is relied upon as a basis for constitutionality of the legislation, the onus is upon those who challenge the constitutionality of the legislation; they have to rebut the presumption.

                     [I]n determining whether a statute is constitutional, the court must determine the object and purpose of the impugned statute for it is important to discern the intention expressed in the Act itself (see Murang’a Bar Operators and another v Minister of State for Provincial Administration and Internal Security and others Nairobi Petition No 3 of 2011 [2011] eKLR, Samuel G Momanyi v Attorney General &amp; another (supra)). Further, in examining whether a particular statutory provision is unconstitutional, the court must have regard not only to its purpose but also its effect. The Canadian Supreme Court in the R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd, [1985] 1 SCR 295 enunciated this principle as follows: -
                    </span>

                       Both purpose and effect are relevant in determining constitutionality; either an unconstitutional purpose or an unconstitutional effect can invalidate legislation. All legislation is animated by an object the legislature intends to achieve. This object is realized through impact produced by the operation and application of the legislation. Purpose and effect respectively, in the sense of the legislation’s object and its ultimate impact, are clearly linked, if not indivisible. Intended and achieved effects have been looked to for guidance in assessing the legislation’s object and thus the validity.

                  The question for our determination in light of the amendments, is whether there remains a tangible and concrete dispute concerning the constitutionality of the Act. We are well guided by the Supreme Court in The Institute for Social Accountability case, (supra), on this issue. In the case, the issue of mootness had first arisen in the Court of Appeal, where the question was whether the enactment of the 2015 Act rendered the appeal moot. The Court of Appeal had found that there was still a dispute requiring adjudication. On further appeal, the Supreme Court held:

                   The common thread from the above decisions is that a matter is moot when it has no practical significance or when the decision will not have the effect of resolving the controversy affecting the rights of the parties before it. If a decision of a court will have no such practical effect on the rights of the parties, a court will decline to decide on the case. Accordingly, there has to be a live controversy between the parties at all stages of the case when a court is rendering its decision. If after the commencement of the proceedings, events occur changing the facts or the law which deprive the parties of the pursued outcome or relief then, the matter becomes moot.

                   To our minds, the highlighted provisions contain some of the pertinent issues that were still raging controversies before the Court of Appeal for determination even after the coming into force of the NGCDF Act, 2015. Moreover, given that the impugned provisions of the CDF Act 2013 had also been re-enacted in the NGCDF Act, 2015, it did not unequivocally settle the issues in dispute between the parties. As such, there was still live controversy between the parties and therefore it was in the public interest to have the questions that were still raging adjudicated and determined by the Court of Appeal. In this regard, we are persuaded by the decision of the Constitutional Court of South Africa in AAA Investments (Pty) Limited v Micro-Finance Regulatory Council &amp; Another 2007 (1) SA 343 (CC), 2006 (11) BCLR 1255 (CC) where it was held at para 27 that even in cases that can be said to be technically moot, it is good practice for the court to seize jurisdiction in a matter where the law on a particular issue is not settled and the question is of critical import to the operation of government.

                   In light of the above, we agree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal that the same violative provisions have been re-enacted into the NGCDF Act, 2015. Therefore, the intervening legislation did not render the appeal moot because the legislation did not unequivocally address the issues raised by the appellants. Consequently, we affirm the finding of the Court of Appeal that the appeal before that court was not moot.

                     The doctrine of mootness requires that controversy must exist throughout judicial proceedings including at the appellate level. An appeal or an issue is moot when a decision will not have the effect of resolving a live controversy affecting or potentially affecting the rights of parties. Such a live controversy must be present not only when the action or proceeding is commenced but also when the court is called upon to reach a decision. The doctrine of mootness is therefore based on the notion that judicial resources ought to be utilized efficiently and should not be dedicated to an abstract proposition of law and that courts should avoid deciding on matters that are abstract, academic, or hypothetical.

                  We however find that there is still a raging dispute calling for adjudication on the remainder of the Act. For instance, the amendments to section 15(1)(e) &amp; (2) empower the Public Service Commission to make recommendations to the Cabinet Secretary on the persons to be appointed as members of the National Government Constituencies Development Fund Board established under section 14 of the Act. However, the appointment is still subject to approval by the National Assembly.

                  In addition, the challenged section 19(2),(3) &amp; (4) of the Act was repealed. The effect of the repeal is that the National Assembly is not involved in the removal of member of the Board. However, the amendments introduced the new section 19(A) for the filling of a vacancy in the Board. Under Section 19(A) (2) to (9) the National Assembly is deeply involved in the consideration, vetting and approval of all applicants nominated by the Cabinet Secretary and has veto power over the nominees. Further, while the Public Service Commission recommends to the Cabinet Secretary persons for appointment as chairperson and members of the Board the final word would seem to still rest with the National Assembly. The National Assembly is also involved in the setting of a budget for the Board.

Although the 2023 amendment to this section deleted the 2022 amendment by removing the words “by-election”, the Committee is still tied to the life of Parliament.

                     The ideal is always a discrete model that ensures effective separation and check on power and functions at all levels and units of devolution, as opposed to a system in which institutions, powers and functions overlap. Essentially, the different levels and units of devolution act as locations of power and enlargements of democratic space, thus enhancing and deepening democracy, democratic methods and people's participation in government processes. Location of power closer to the people also achieves public accountability since power is easier to control at the local rather than at the national level…

                     Again, poorly designed devolution units may mean expensive duplication of ineffective government; over-bureaucratizing the decision-making process as well as weakening the process of accountability. Moreover, the unjustifiable multiplication of machineries and processes of intergovernmental consultations may result in government rigidity and the accompanying resource and opportunity costs.

                   Devolution is the core promise of the new Constitution. It reverses the system of control and authority established by the colonial powers and continued by successive Presidents. The large panoply of institutions that play a role in devolution-matters, evidences the central place of devolution in the deconstruction-reconstruction of the Kenyan state. Thus, a “Chapter 11-Only” approach would wrongly obscure the interlocking nature of devolution with other aspects and institutions of the

                   , an element which is critical to its success. These other elements include Treasury, which plays a significant role in public finance matters; Parliament, which requires a functional Senate to provide sufficient protection to the devolved governments, and ensure that there is no gridlock in the budgetary or legislative processes; Judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, whose mandate under Article 163(6) is to give ‘advisory opinion… on any matter concerning county government’, and which is an arena for arbitrating conflicts between the National Government and County Governments; Independent Commissions and Offices, such as Controller of Budget and Auditor General, which are crucial in ensuring probity and accountability.

                   This court’s jurisprudence is to the effect that a matter touching on county government incorporates any national-level process bearing a significant impact on the conduct of county government. As such, it is important to consider the functions that would be funded by the money derived from the new constitutional basis for the CDF under the amended section 4(2) of the CDF Act. As stated elsewhere in this judgment, Section 3 of the CDF Act 2013 provides that “the object and purpose of the Act is to ensure that a specific portion of the national annual budget is devoted to the constituencies for purposes of infrastructural development, wealth creation, and the fight against poverty at the constituency level.” Therefore, some of the functions contemplated under section 3 of the CDF Act 2013 such as infrastructural development and the fight against poverty are also functions bestowed upon the county government under Part 2 of the Fourth Schedule to the

We however note that these functions are distinct with each level of government given a specific area of operation.

                     Taking into account that we have already made a finding that the wide reach of the Fund under section 22(1) of the CDF Act 2013 will inevitably involve the fund in the implementation of functions constitutionally assigned to the county governments, we find that there is a real threat of the Fund creating confusion as to which project is being implemented by which level of government. In addition, it creates the prospect of duplication of funding for the same project leading to wastage of scarce public resources. Lastly, it creates a state of lack of clarity as to which level of government is responsible for which particular project therefore compromising on accountability. [emphasis added]

                  respondent outlined the background and evolution of the Fund and the Act as impugned. In his view, the National Assembly remedied the defects of the 2013 Act which was subject of High Court Petition No. 71 of 2013, by enacting the 2015 Act long before the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment on the appeal in Petiti on 71 of 2013. He highlighted the administrative and financial structure of the Act and the nature of projects undertaken under the impugned Act. He submitted that the Act does not violate the division of functions between the national and county governments nor does it contravene the principles of public finance. In his view, the Act was a vital instrument for the implementation of national government functions at the grass root levels and therefore urged this court to dismiss the petition.

                   A similarly important provision to the determination of this question is section 3 of the CDF Act 20132013 quoted in paragraph 71 of this Judgment. A look at the Fourth Schedule of the

                   (pursuant to the terms of article 186(1) of the

                   ) that distributes functions between the national government and the county governments, shows that it is the county governments that are allocated most of the functions and powers that can be said to be “community” or “local” in orientation. Examples of such functions and powers include those relating to county health services, county transport, trade development, county public works and services, pre-primary education, and village polytechnics, amongst others. In contrast, to a large extent, the functions and powers of the national government with respect to most of these functions relate to policy formulation. This approach in the fourth schedule of the
                   <a aria-expanded="false" class="akn-ref" data-href="/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution" href="/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution" target="_blank">

                   resonates with the principle of “subsidiarity” which underpins the division of powers under devolved systems of government. Subsidiarity is the broad presumption that sub-national governments ought to be assigned those functions and powers which vitally affect the life of the inhabitants and allow the development of the country in accordance with local conditions of sub-national units, while matters of national importance concerning the country as a whole and overarching policy formulation are assigned to the national government. It follows and we so find that the implementation of community-based projects envisaged under section 22 and the infrastructural development projects envisaged under section 3 of the CDF Act 2013 would inevitably cover and target the functions assigned to county governments.

                   It is against this context, that we must determine the question posed as to whether Section 22(1) of the CDF Act 2013 allowing the CDF to fund “community- based projects” that veer to the functional competence of the county governments threatens or violates the principle of prudent and responsible management of public funds enshrined in article 201(d) of the

                   Taking into account that we have already made a finding that the wide reach of the Fund under section 22(1) of the CDF Act 2013 will inevitably involve the fund in the implementation of functions constitutionally assigned to the county governments, we find that there is a real threat of the Fund creating confusion as to which project is being implemented by which level of government. In addition, it creates the prospect of duplication of funding for the same project leading to wastage of scarce public resources. Lastly, it creates a state of lack of clarity as to which level of government is responsible for which particular project therefore compromising on accountability.

                   While we appreciate the concerns that motivated the creation of the CDF and public support for it, there are more effective ways of decentralizing funding to the local level without compromising on key constitutional principles like those of public finance. For example, it is possible to channel the funding through the two governmental structures provided in the
                   <a aria-expanded="false" class="akn-ref" data-href="/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution" href="/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution" target="_blank">

                   </a>
                   , for example, to the county governments as conditional or unconditional grants as envisaged in article 202(2); or, through the structures of the national government at the local levels as contemplated in article 6(3). We further note that even though the CDF (Amendment) Act, 2013 provides that the monies under the Act shall be considered as funds allocated under article 206 (2) (c), under Section 10 of the CDF Act 2013, the Cabinet Secretary in allocating the fund for each financial year must seek concurrence of the relevant Parliamentary Committee. This clearly violates the principles of accountability and integrity due to likely conflict of interest. This is because a Member of Parliament cannot oversee the implementation or coordination of the projects and at the same time offer oversight over the same projects. To this end, we find that the CDF as structured under the CDF Act 2013 violates the constitutional principles on public finance, particularly the principle of prudent and responsible management of public funds as enshrined in article 201(d) of the
                   <a aria-expanded="false" class="akn-ref" data-href="/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution" href="/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution" target="_blank">

                   may be considered as development projects for purposes of this Act provided that the allocation to such activities does not exceed five per centum of the total allocation to the constituency in that financial year.

                   We take the view that Article 201 expresses the idea of responsible governance. It envisages that the two levels of government will manage fiscal resources prudently by putting in systems that ensures that the implementation of projects aimed at delivering a public good and service is cost-effective. It also embodies the desire for fiscal efficiency which speaks to the need to eliminate wastages in service delivery and provision of public good and service. It means that where it is a policy objective of the government to deliver a particular public good or service then the system for delivery of that policy objective should be designed in a manner that ensures that public funds are not wasted or abused.

                  Act under section 10(2) provides for the purpose of the emergency fund being to enable payments to be made in respect of a county when an urgent and unforeseen need for expenditure arises for which there is no specific legislative authority. This fund at the county level is administered by the county government Secretary while at the national government level, it is administered by the Treasury under the management of the Cabinet Secretary responsible for matters relating to Finance.

                  Having considered the functions of the emergency reserve and the contingency and emergency funds, we have no doubt in our minds that the emergency reserve is a replica of the above two other funds established by statute and consequently, we are in agreement with the petitioners that the 2015 Act created a duplication of activities and or wastage of resources which could alternatively be assigned to the county governments as provided in article 186(3).

                  It is important to have clarity about which level of government is empowered to do what. This avoids confusion and duplication of mandates and responsibilities, and allows for proper accountability to citizens in respect of service delivery. When there is no clarity, blame can easily be shifted from one sphere of government to the other.

                  We are therefore persuaded that first, the Fund has the potential of creating confusion in the implementation of projects by the two levels of government. Second, duplication of funding for the same project is inevitable leading to wastage of scarce public resources. Lastly, the Fund fosters a state of lack of clarity as to which level of government is responsible for which particular project thereby compromising accountability.

                  In determining the above issue, this court acknowledges that the Supreme Court in The Institute for Social Accountability case (supra) explored in detail, the doctrine of separation of powers and its significance, describing it as “a key organizational framework for governance under the 2010 Constitutional Scheme.” The Court emphasized that the doctrine is a fundamental principle of law that requires the three arms of government to remain separate, and that one arm of government should not usurp functions belonging to another arm. Appreciating this dichotomy, the court stated:

                     The idea of separating the functions and personnel of the three branches of government is intended to give effect to the related concept of ‘checks and balances’ which is linked to the constitutional principles and values of accountability and good governance; which guarantees that a branch does oversight the discharge of the mandate by a different branch thereby providing restraint on the exercise of public power, for example, the Legislature should oversight the discharge of functions by the Executive branch.

                  The apex Court was categorical in the above case that “allowing Legislators any role, even a merely ceremonial role in discharging a mandate that belongs to the executive branch at either the national or the county level, would promote conflict of interest and compromise their oversight role.”

                  Whereas the role of the National Assembly in the above two scenarios under sections 15 (1) (e) and 43 (4) and (5) can safely be said to be oversight role, the catch is in section 43(9) which is clear that the Fund Account Manager who is the holder of the purse to the Fund, seconded by the Board to the Constituency shall be the custodian of all records and equipment of the Constituency during the term of Parliament and during transition occasioned by general election or a by election. What this clearly means is that the term of the Fund Account Manager is tied to the term of Parliament which is five years or in the case of a by election. All this implies that the Member of the National Assembly remains in the shadows of the Fund, controlling its operations, however remotely, at the constituency level.

                     consciously delegates the sovereign power under it to the three branches of government and expects that each will carry out those functions assigned to it without interference from the other two…. this must mean that the Courts must show deference to the independence of the Legislature as an important institution in the maintenance of our constitutional democracy as well as accord the Executive sufficient latitude to implement legislative intent. Yet…the courts have an interpretive role-including the last word in determining the constitutionality of all governmental actions. That, too, is an incidence of the doctrine of separation of powers.

The essence of separation of powers, in this context, is that the totality of governance powers is shared out among different organs of government, and that these organs play mutually-countervailing roles. In this set up, it is to be recognized that none of the several government organs functions in splendid isolation.

                  Addressing this issue in The Institute for Social Accountability case, (supra) the Supreme Court observed that these twin constitutional provisions are not a license to create a “third” or “parallel” level of government at the constituency. Further, that the decentralization of service delivery must be undertaken within the confines of the structures of the national government or county governments, not parallel to these two levels of government. To do otherwise would create a “third” or “parallel” structure of government which has the effect of altering the basic premises of the system of government created by the

                   , the idea of constituency whenever it is used is linked to being an electoral unit for political representation. In its true essence, a constituency is a form of territorial districting that defines how voters are grouped for the election of Members of Parliament and are not conceptually envisaged to be service delivery units. This leads to an ineluctable conclusion that the role that a constituency as an electoral unit discharges and its place within the constitutional scheme is tied to the functions constitutionally vested in the Member of the National Assembly. That role is a legislative role and not a service delivery mandate. Therefore, we find that the constituency under the constitutional scheme is tied to the election of representatives to the legislature and representation of the people of the constituency at the National Assembly.

                  The petitioners’ case is that the Act offends the principles of public finance contained in Article 201.

They contend that the 2015 Act which was intended to cure the unconstitutionality of the 2013 Act as found by the High Court in January 2015 in The

                  It is their contention that the Act undermines devolution, causes conflicts between county and national governments and between the Members of Parliament and governors. Further that the 2015 Act compromises the principles of fair elections, sustains corruption, intrudes on the functions of the national and county governments and in turn causes a wastage of resources.

                  The petitioners submitted that both national and county governments have elaborate offices and bodies to implement their respective functions. The structures for implementing executive functions at both levels of government are stipulated in statutory instruments including the

                  It was further argued that the Act creates a stand-alone project conceptualization, funding and implementation structure that is not anchored on or referenced to the national government development plans or county integrated development plans. They referred to section 27 of the Act which deals with the constituency strategic development plan without elaborating whether the same is synchronized to national or county development plans.

                  The petitioners submitted that section 52 of the Act makes it clear that the Fund is not intended to be harmonized with the national government plans and hence duplication. The Court however notes that this section was repealed in 2023, and we have already found that it is moot.

                  , the national government can through legislation assign some of its functions to counties. Similarly, that under Article 183(1)(b), national legislation can assign the implementation of executive functions to the county executive. Additionally, that Article 202(2) enables the national government to finance such functions and policy objectives in the counties through conditional grants. It is the petitioners’ argument that these provisions can be used to avoid duplication and to foster prudent use of resources and proper fiscal planning.

                  respondent’s position on this issue is that the general structure of the Fund under Parts IV, V, VI and VII of the Act adheres to the principles of public finance on prudent use and responsible financial management. It was submitted that contrary to the petitioners’ claim, the Act does not establish parallel and duplicative offices, but that the structure therein is complementary to the development effort by the national government. Further that the said structure is a realization of checks and balances and for effective implementation and delivery of services under the Act.

This leads to wastage of public resources and militates against the constitutional principles of prudent and responsible use of resources and responsible financial management and clear fiscal planning.

                   in entrenching the principles of public finance, embodies the promise of fiscal discipline and accountability in the management of public finances in Kenya. It seeks to re-engineer the management of public resources, especially public finances by enshrining principles to guide and inform all dealings with public finance. Crucial to the current dispute, is article 201(d) which directs that “public money should be used in a prudent and responsible way”. Dr John Mutakha Kangu in ‘Constitutional Law of Kenya on Devolution’ (Strathmore University Press, Nairobi, 2015) at page 240 remarks on the normative demands of this provision as follows:

                      “‘Prudent’ here connotes a measure of carefulness, precaution, wisdom and good judgment in the expenditure and use of money. It calls for sensible, economical and frugal use of public funds. As used in this provision, the term embodies the concept of value for money and use of money for the right purposes. ‘Responsible’, on the other hand, involves the quality of being accountable for one’s actions and responsive to the needs of the people. The two terms imply avoidance of wasteful use of funds and the choosing of priorities that are beneficial to the people.”

                   We take the view that article 201 expresses the idea of responsible governance. It envisages that the two levels of government will manage fiscal resources prudently by putting in systems that ensures that the implementation of projects aimed at delivering a public good and service is cost-effective. It also embodies the desire for fiscal efficiency which speaks to the need to eliminate wastages in service delivery and provision of public good and service. It means that where it is a policy objective of the government to deliver a particular public good or service then the system for delivery of that policy objective should be designed in a manner that ensures that public funds are not wasted or abused.

                  Under section 27, the constituency committee is charged with the task of deliberating on project proposals from all wards in the constituency and any other project that may be beneficial to the constituency. The committee is also required to consider the constituency strategic plan and identify a list of priority projects to be submitted to the Board. The funding of projects is provided for under section 25 of the Act. The projects are then implemented by the project management committee, pursuant to section 36. Section 54 provides that the provisions of the Act are complimentary to any other development efforts by the national government or any other agency. It further provides that nothing in the Act shall be taken or interpreted to mean that an area may be excluded from any other development programmes. This to our minds means that no area of development is out of the reach of this Fund under the Act and can directly encroach even on the functions of the county governments under the Fourth Schedule of the

                  It is quite clear from the foregoing, that projects under the Act may include those undertaken by both the national and county governments. Accordingly, given the governments at both levels also budget for all their functions, programmes and projects, allocating money to the Fund leads to double financing of the same functional areas. This clearly undermines the fiscal efficiency imperative that eliminates wastages in service delivery. Duplication of projects and programmes even if intended for the public good, will inevitably result in wastage or abuse of public funds allocated for the same. In such circumstances, fiscal reporting cannot be clear.

                   The implication of the principle of prudent and responsible management of public money for questions of inter-governmental relations is that there should be clarity in the allocation and assignment of tasks to avoid duplication in the deployment of resources.

John Mutakha Kangu in ‘Constitutional Law of Kenya on Devolution’ (supra) at page 177 aptly captures this concern as follows:

                   Taking into account that we have already made a finding that the wide reach of the Fund under section 22(1) of the CDF Act 2013 will inevitably involve the fund in the implementation of functions constitutionally assigned to the county governments, we find that there is a real threat of the Fund creating confusion as to which project is being implemented by which level of government. In addition, it creates the prospect of duplication of funding for the same project leading to wastage of scarce public resources. Lastly, it creates a state of lack of clarity as to which level of government is responsible for which particular project therefore compromising on accountability.

                  It is common ground that the Act provides for conceptualization, funding and implementation of projects within constituencies. As we have stated above, under section 54, no area is out of the reach of the Act and projects thereunder may extend to functions of both the national and county governments. We have already found that the Fund has the potential of creating confusion in the implementation of projects by the two levels of government and to duplicate funding for the same projects leading to wastage of scarce public resources and compromising accountability.

That the allocation of funds before the vertical division of revenue undermines the equitable element of sharing of funds required under Articles 202 and 203 as it decreases the resources available to the counties, while increasing those to the national government.

They contended that the Division of Revenue Act clearly outlined the division of total shareable revenue between the two levels of government. Further, that the allocation to the Fund in the financial year 2016/2017 came during the consideration and approval of the Appropriations Act, 2016, which was enacted way after the Division of Revenue Act.

                  We have considered the arguments on the issue. The law is that the division of revenue between the national and county governments is to be done equitably and from all revenue raised nationally. Under Article 201(b)(ii) of the

Section 4(1)(a) of the 2015 Act provides that the amount to be allocated to the Fund shall be not less than 2.5% of all the national government's share of revenue. Article 218(1) requires the introduction of the Division of Revenue Bill at least two months before the end of each financial year.

                   The gist of the dispute between the parties revolves around the interpretation of article 201(b)(ii) which provides that revenue raised nationally shall be shared equitably among national and county governments against section 4 of the CDF Act 2013 which establishes a Constituency Development Fund and which indicates that it is a national fund consisting of monies of an amount not less than 2.5% of all the national government ordinary revenue collected every financial year. The money is to be disbursed by the national government through the CDF Board as a grant to be channeled to the constituencies in the manner provided for by the Act.

                   which stipulates that ‘revenue raised nationally shall be shared equitably among the national and county governments’, we need to bear in mind that a key concern behind the enactment of the provision was to ensure the optimal funding and working of the devolved system of government. In addition, we need to adopt a harmonious interpretation of the
                   <a aria-expanded="false" class="akn-ref" data-href="/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution" href="/akn/ke/act/2010/constitution" target="_blank">

It provides that ‘a Division of Revenue Bill, shall divide revenue raised by the national government among the national and county levels of government in accordance with this Constitution’.

                   Our understanding of what is contemplated by articles 202 (1) and 218(1)(a) of Constitution is that ‘revenue raised nationally’ is all the revenue accruing from all the revenue-raising powers of the national government. ‘Revenue raised nationally’ is synonymous with what is termed ‘equitable share’ and is allocated between the two levels of government. Prior to allocation, this revenue is not yet available to the national government to allocate to its agencies. Only after the national government has received its portion of the equitable share under the Division of Revenue Act as envisaged in article 218(1)(a), will it be in a position to allocate funds to agencies and instrumentalities falling under its mandate.

                   It follows that the national government and county governments are the only entities entitled to participate in the vertical division of the “revenue raised nationally”.

                   This brings into focus the principle of ripeness which prevents a party from approaching a Court prematurely at a time when he/she has not yet been subject to prejudice, or the real threat of prejudice, as a result of conduct alleged to be unlawful. None of the parties deemed it fit to address this pertinent legal point. The principle of ripeness was aptly captured by Kriegler J[34] in the following words:-“The essential flaw in the applicants' cases is one of timing or, as the Americans and, occasionally the Canadians call it, "ripeness"... Suffice it to say that the doctrine of ripeness serves the useful purpose of highlighting that the business of a court is generally retrospective; it deals with situations or problems that have already ripened or crystallised, and not with prospective or hypothetical ones. Although, as Professor Sharpe points out and our Constitution acknowledges, the criteria for hearing a constitutional case are more generous than for ordinary suits, even cases for relief on constitutional grounds are not decided in the air. ...The time of this Court is too valuable to be frittered away on hypothetical fears of corporate skeletons being discovered.”

                   Lord Bridge of Harwich put it more succinctly when he stated:- “It has always been a fundamental feature of our judicial system that the Courts decide disputes between the parties before them; they do not pronounce on abstract questions of law when there is no dispute to be resolved.”[35]It is perfectly true that usually the Court does not solve hypothetical problems and abstract questions and declaratory actions cannot be brought unless the rights in question in such action have actually been infringed.[36] The requirement of a dispute between the parties is a general limitation to the jurisdiction of the Court. The existence of a dispute is the primary condition for the Court to exercise its judicial function.[37] On the other hand, mootness involves the situation where a dispute no longer exists. Ripeness asks whether a dispute exists, that is, whether it has come into being.

                   Effectively, the justiciability dogma prohibits the court from entertaining hypothetical or academic interest cases. The court is not expected to engage in abstract arguments. The court is prevented from determining an issue when it is too early or simply out of apprehension, hence the principle of ripeness. An issue before the court must be ripe, through a factual matrix, for determination.

                   Conversely, the court is also prevented from determining an issue when it is too late. When an issue no longer presents an existing or live controversy, then it is said to be moot and not worthy of taking the much sought judicial time.

                  Per Kimondo &amp; Aburili, JJ: The Fund has been in operation since 2003. Its centrality and the value of its programmes to the local communities across 290 constituencies cannot be gainsaid. We are also alive to the fact that there are short-term, medium-term and long-term projects already being implemented by the Fund. Moreover, the life span of the projects is not necessarily pegged to the financial year. In addition, the Fund has employees and may have contracts with third parties. Lastly, we are now in the middle of the current financial year and funds may have been allocated for ongoing projects. Accordingly, and despite our finding that the 2015 Act as last amended in 2023 is unconstitutional, it will not be in the interest of the nation or of the cause of justice to bring it to an abrupt closure.
