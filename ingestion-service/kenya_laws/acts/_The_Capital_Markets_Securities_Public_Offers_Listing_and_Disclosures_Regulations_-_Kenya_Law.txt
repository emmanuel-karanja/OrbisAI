FOURTH SCHEDULE 
[r. 11]
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL ISSUES
(Rights, scrip dividend, capitalization issues and open offers.)
1.
An issuer of securities to the public must ensure equality of treatment for all holders of such securities of the-same class in respect of all rights attaching to such securities.
2.
An issuer proposing to issue shares for cash may first offer those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. Only to the extent that the securities are not taken up by such persons under the offer, may they then be issued for cash to others or otherwise than in the proportion to their existing holdings.
3.
An issuer shall not issue shares which confer a controlling interest without prior approval of shareholders in general meeting through a special resolution.
4.
An issuer intending to make an additional issue should make an announcement within twenty-four hours from the board's resolution to recommend the additional issue to the shareholders and such announcement shall state that the issue is subject to the approval of the shareholders and the Authority.
5.
(1) Where an issuer obtains a general approval from the shareholders to issue shares for purposes of acquisition and authorizes directors to issue such shares for that purpose, the directors shall disclose to the shareholders and the general public any acquisition involving such shares in which an existing shareholder has an interest, or where the shareholding percentage or structure of the existing shareholding will change as a result of such acquisition.
(2)
Where as a result of such acquisition a shareholder by virtue of shares arising out of the acquisition is in a position to exercise control of an issuer, such acquisition shall only be carried out with a special resolution of the shareholders in general meeting notwithstanding the existence of the general provisions.
6.
Where an issuer which has listed shares has received notification from its parent company that the parent company proposes to participate in future issues of shares by the issuer not made to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings (in order to maintain its percentage shareholding in the issuer), such participation shall first be authorised by the shareholders in general meeting by special resolution and such authority shall be valid for a period of twelve months unless renewed by shareholders at another general meeting.
7.
An issuer must obtain the consent of shareholders before any subsidiary company of the issuer makes any issue of shares for cash or transfer of existing shares of such subsidiary company so as to materially dilute the issuer's percentage interest in the shares of that subsidiary company. For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 5 (1) above, a subsidiary company which represents 25% or more of the aggregate of the share capital and reserves or profits (after deducting all charges except taxation and excluding extraordinary items) of the group will be regarded as a major subsidiary company.
8.
The obligation to obtain the consent of shareholders set out in paragraph 7 does not apply if the subsidiary company is itself listed and so must comply with paragraph 6. In such a case, the issuer must ensure that its equity interest in the subsidiary company is not materially diluted through any new cash issue or transfer of shares by such subsidiary company. In the case of a rights issue, if the issuer does not propose to take up its rights, an arrangement must be made for the rights to be offered to its shareholders so that they can avoid a material dilution in their percentage equity interest.
9.
In a rights issue or open offer an issuer need not comply with paragraph (8) above with respect to:
(a)
securities representing fractional entitlements; or
(b)
securities which the directors of the issuer consider necessary or expedient to exclude from the offer on account of either legal problems under the laws of any territory or the requirements of a regulatory body, provided that the Authority's consent is obtained.
10.
In relation to a rights issue in which shareholders are given the right to participate in proportion to the amount of existing shares, such rights shall allow for renunciabilitv in part or in whole in favour of a third party at the option of the entitled shareholders.

13.
Except in the case of a rights issue to shareholders, no director of an issuer shall be given preferential allotment directly or indirectly in an issue of shares or other securities with rights of conversion to shares unless shareholders in general meeting have approved of the specific allotment to be made to such director.
The notice of meeting shall state:
(a)
the number of securities to be so allotted;
(b)
the precise terms and conditions of the issue; and
(c)
that such directors shall abstain from exercising any voting rights.
14.

15.
Once the basis of the entitlement is declared the issuer shall not make any subsequent alterations to such entitlements.

Interim and quarterly reports

"interim report"
 means half year financial reports to be issued within sixty days of the interim balance date;
"final report"
 means annual/ year-end financial report;
"quarterly report"
 means a financial report, other than an interim or final report, covering a period of three months issued in the course of a financial year on a best practice basis.
(2) All interim reports shall be prepared in accordance with the relevant provisions of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
(3) All issuers who have adopted a quarterly reporting practice shall, except in the case of a report issued pursuant to paragraph B.18, continue to issue reports on a quarterly basis in order to maintain consistency.
B.07
Every issuer of securities issued to the public approved by the Authority whether or not such securities are listed, shall prepare and publish an interim report within sixty days of the respective interim reporting date. An interim financial report shall include at a minimum the following components:
(a) condensed balance sheet;
(b) condensed income statement;
(c) condensed statement showing either—
(i) all changes in equity; or
(ii) changes in equity other than those arising from capital transactions with owners and distributions to owners (statement of recognised gains and losses);
(d) condensed cash flow statement; and
(e) selected explanatory notes.
B.08
If an issuer publishes a set of condensed financial statements in its interim financial report, those condensed statements should include, at a minimum, each of the headings and subtotals that were included in its most recent annual financial statements and the selected explanatory notes. Additional line items or notes should be included if their omission would make the condensed interim financial statements misleading.
B.09
Basic and diluted earnings per share should be presented on the face of an income statement, complete or condensed, for an interim period.
B.10
An issuer should include the following information, as a minimum, in the notes to its interim financial statements, if material and if not disclosed elsewhere in the interim financial report:
(a) a statement that the same accounting policies and methods of computation are followed in the interim financial statements as compared with the most recent annual financial statements or, if those policies or methods have been changed, a description of the nature and effect of the change;
(b) explanatory comments about the seasonality or cyclicality of interim operations;
(c) the nature and amount of items affecting assets, liabilities, equity, net income, or cash flows that are unusual because of their nature, size, or incidence; and
(d) the nature and amount of changes in estimates of amounts reported.
The information should normally be reported on a financial year-to-date basis. However, the issuer should also disclose any events or transactions that are material to an understanding of the current interim period.
B.11
Interim reports should include interim financial statements (condensed or complete) for periods as follows:
(a) balance sheet as of the end of the current interim period and a comparative balance sheet as of the end of the immediately preceding financial year;
(b) income statements for the current interim period and cumulatively for the current financial year to date, with comparative income statements for the comparable interim periods (current and year-to-date) of the immediately preceding financial year;
(c) a statement showing changes in equity cumulatively for the current financial year to date, with a comparative statement for the comparable year-to-date period of the immediately preceding financial year: and

B.12
If an estimate of an amount reported in an interim period is changed significantly during the financial year and a separate financial report is not published for that interim period, the nature and amount of that change in estimate should be disclosed in a note to the annual financial statements for that financial year.
B.13
An issuer should apply the same accounting policies in its interim financial statements as are applied in its annual financial statements, except for accounting policy changes made after the date of the most recent annual financial statements that are to be reflected in the next annual financial statements. However, the frequency of an issuer's reporting (annual, half-yearly, or quarterly) should not affect the measurement of its annual results. To achieve that objective, measurements for interim reporting purposes should be made on a year-to-date basis.
B.14
Revenues that are received seasonally, cyclically, or occasionally within a financial year should not be anticipated or deferred as of an interim date if anticipation or deferral would not be appropriate at the end of the issuer's financial year.
B.15
Costs that are incurred unevenly during an issuer's financial year should be anticipated or deferred for interim reporting purposes if, and only if, it is also appropriate to anticipate or defer that type of cost at the end of the financial year.
B.16
The measurement procedures to be followed in an interim financial report should be designed to ensure that the resulting information is reliable and that all material financial information that is relevant to an understanding of the financial position or performance of the enterprise is appropriately disclosed. While measurements in both annual and interim financial reports are often based on reasonable estimates, the preparation of interim financial reports generally will require a greater use of estimation methods than annual financial reports.
B.17
A change in accounting policy, other than one for which the transition is specified by a new IAS, should be reflected by—
(a) restating the financial statements of prior interim periods of the current financial year and the comparable interim periods of prior financial years, if the issuer follows the benchmark treatment under IAS 8; or
(b) restating the financial statements of prior interim periods of the current financial year, if the issuer follows the allowed alternative treatment under IAS 8. In this case, comparable interim periods of prior financial years are not restated.
B.18
Any announcement made by the issuer in respect of—
(a) a dividend;
(b) a capitalisation or rights issue;
(c) the closing of the books;
(d) a capital return; or
(e) sales or turnover,
shall be issued so as to coincide with the release of the annual, interim or quarterly financial statement.
B.19
