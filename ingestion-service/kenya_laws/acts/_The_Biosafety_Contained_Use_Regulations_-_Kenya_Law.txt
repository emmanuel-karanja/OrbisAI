CONTAINMENT MEASURES
PART I
CLASSIFICATION OF CONTAINMENT LEVEL
Level 1 Activities with no or negligible risk of adverse effect on human health, the environment and biological diversity.
Level 2 Activities with low risk of adverse effect on human health, the environment and biological diversity that can easily be eliminated using generally known procedures for which the level of containment and protective measures are laid down.
Level 3 Activities with a moderate risk of such adverse effect on human health, the environment and biological diversity that can only be eliminated by especially demanding interventions for which the level of containment and protective measures are laid down.

Section 2: Submission
 
Please fill out Section 2 for each individual Submission included in the application.
2.1 Name or Designation of animal or organism Novel Trait (NT)
2.2 Novel Trait(s) Identification (Tick as appropriate)
☐ Genetic Research.
☐ Pharmaceutical.
☐ Generation of mutants.
☐ Insect Resistance.
☐ Stress Tolerance
☐ Fungal Resistance.
☐ Nutritional change.
☐ Increased production of milk or wool
☐ Genes knocked out to allow xeno transplantation
☐ Faster, more efficient growth rates
☐ Increased tolerance to cold water for fish.
☐ Improved meat, milk or wool quality
☐ Leaner, more tender beef and pork.
☐ Resistance to diseases caused by viruses,
bacteria and other pathogens.
☐ Milk that lacks allergenic proteins, or results in increased amounts of cheese and yogurt.
☐ Development of animals that serve as models for human diseases to help scientists better understand prevention and treatment strategies.
☐ Possession of characteristics which
are environmentally friendly e.g. improved use of dietary phosphorous to lessen the environmental impacts of animal manure
☐ In the phylogenetic analysis of the
amplified nucleic acid sequences to provide novel information on the evolution of pathogens.
☐ Animal vaccines rationally designed for the specific control and eradication of diseases, including the implementation of DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) strategies.
☐ Development of diagnostic kits that can not only be used in the laboratory but pen-side tests that can be used in the field to make decisions about the exposure of animals during a disease outbreak.
☐ In epidemiology to characterize pathogens through determination of their nucleotide sequence. The possibility of pinpointing the source of infection can significantly contribute to improved disease control.
☐ Cloning to enable the rapid dissemination of superior genotypes from nucleus breeding flocks and herds, directly to commercial farmers. Genotypes could be provided that are ideally suited for specific product characteristics, disease resistance, or environmental conditions.
☐ Cloning to help salvage the germplasm of indigenous species that are near extinction, including intra-species nuclear transfer procedures which can be used to rescue genes from endangered species.
☐ New and improved medicines for animals. e.g. Gene therapy which involves the insertion of a functional gene or another molecule that contains an information sequence into a cell to achieve a therapeutic effect. Thus, the gene serves as a drug.
☐ Producing large amounts of therapeutic - proteins in animal milk or meat (biopharm animals or transgenic animal bioreactors) may be an efficient, relatively low cost method to manufacture many proteins used to treat human diseases or proteins that have industrial value.
☐ In the development of novel diagnostic assays, e.g. PCR and isothermal amplification methods, microarrays, protein detection by nucleic acid amplification, recombinant proteins, synthetic proteins, biosensors etc. to detect the pathogens and/or the immune responses after infection.
