TWELFTH SCHEDULE 
[r. 16]
DISCLOSURE AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL ISSUES
(Rights, scrip dividend, capitalization issues and open offers)
PART A: DISCLOSURE AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL ISSUES FOR ISSUERS LISTED IN THE MAIN INVESTMENT MARKET SEGMENT
1.
Issue of shares
1.1.
An issuer of securities to the public must ensure equality of treatment for all holders of such securities of the same class in respect of all rights attaching to such securities.
1.2.
Subject to the provisions of Part XIV of the Companies Act, 2015, an issuer proposing to issue shares for cash may first offer those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. Only to the extent that the securities are not taken up by such persons under the offer, may they then be issued for cash to others or otherwise than in the proportion to their existing holdings.
1.3.
An issuer shall not issue shares which confer a controlling interest without prior approval of shareholders in a general meeting through a special resolution.
1.4.
An issuer intending to make an additional issue should make an announcement within twenty-four hours from the board’s resolution to recommend the additional issue to the shareholders and such announcement shall state that the issue is subject to the approval of the shareholders and the Authority.
1.5.
1.5.1. Where an issuer obtains a general approval from the shareholders to issue shares for purposes of acquisition and authorizes directors to issue such shares for that purpose, the directors shall disclose to the shareholders and the general public any acquisition involving such shares in which an existing shareholder has an interest, or where the shareholding percentage or structure of the existing shareholding will change as a result of such acquisition.
1.5.2. Where as a result of such acquisition a shareholder by virtue of shares arising out of the acquisition is in a position to exercise control of an issuer, such acquisition shall only be carried out with a special resolution of the shareholders in general meeting notwithstanding the existence of the general provisions.
2.
Authorisation of Issue
2.1.
Subject always to the provisions of Part XIV of the Companies Act, 2015, where an issuer which has listed shares has received notification from its parent company that the parent company proposes to participate in future issues of shares by the issuer not made to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings (in order to maintain its percentage shareholding in the issuer), such participation shall first be authorised by the shareholders in a general meeting by special resolution and such authority shall be valid for a period of twelve months unless renewed by shareholders at another general meeting.
2.2.
An issuer must obtain the consent of shareholders before any subsidiary company of the issuer makes any issue of shares for cash or transfer of existing shares of such subsidiary company so as to materially dilute the issuer’s percentage interest in the shares of that subsidiary company. For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 2.1, a subsidiary company which represents twenty-five per cent or more of the aggregate of the share capital and reserves or profits (after deducting all charges except taxation and excluding extraordinary items) of the group will be regarded as a major subsidiary company.
2.3.
The obligation to obtain the consent of shareholders set out in paragraph 2.2 does not apply if the subsidiary company is itself listed and so must comply with paragraph 2.1. In such a case, the issuer must ensure that its equity interest in the subsidiary company is not materially diluted through any new cash issue or transfer of shares by such subsidiary company. In the case of a rights issue, if the issuer does not propose to take up its rights, an arrangement must be made for the rights to be offered to its shareholders so that they can avoid a material dilution in their percentage equity interest.
3.
Renunciation and other entitlements
3.1.
In a rights issue or open offer, an issuer need not comply with paragraph 2.3 with respect to:
3.1.1. securities representing fractional entitlements; or
3.1.2. securities which the directors of the issuer consider necessary or expedient to exclude from the offer on account of either legal problems under the laws of any territory, or the requirements of a regulatory body, provided that the Authority's consent is obtained.
3.2.
In relation to a rights issue in which shareholders are given the right to participate in proportion to the amount of existing shares, such rights shall allow for renunciability in part or in whole in favour of a third party at the option of the entitled shareholders.
3.3.
In relation to rights issues and an open offer, the issuer shall fix the closing date for the receipt of applications for, and acceptance of the new shares not later than thirty days after the books closing date.
3.4.
An issuer shall issue to the persons entitled to a rights issue within ten days after a books closing date:
3.4.1. letter of entitlement of rights; and
3.4.2. provisional letter of allotment incorporating:
3.4.2.1. form of acceptance;
3.4.2.2. request for splits;
3.4.2.3. form of renunciation; and
3.4.2.4. excess shares application form.
3.5.
Except where a director is also a shareholder entitled to the rights provided in this Schedule, no director of an issuer shall be given preferential allotment directly or indirectly in an issue of shares or other securities with rights of conversion to shares unless shareholders in general meeting have approved of the specific allotment to be made to such director. The notice of meeting shall state:
3.5.1. the number of securities to be so allotted;
3.5.2. the precise terms and conditions of the issue; and
3.5.3. that such directors shall abstain from exercising any voting rights.
3.6.
When shareholders are offered a specific entitlement in a new issue of shares, such entitlement must be on 
pro rata
 basis with no restrictions placed on the number of shares to be held before entitlements accrue.
3.7.
Once the basis of the entitlement is declared the issuer shall not make any subsequent alterations to such entitlements.
4.
