the Fund
 more than the amount (if any) of such excess.
(b)
The Board may require any 
member
 who has been granted an exemption under this subsection, from time to time, to produce the receipts for his contributions or other evidence of his continuing to be a contributor under such 
approved scheme
, and if he fails to do so 
the Board
 may cancel the exemption.

where there are two or more beneficiaries receiving pensions in respect of the same 
member

member
 shall, if such child is being paid a 
pension
 or a share of a 
pension
 under this Act, continue to be paid such 
pension
 or such share.
(3)
Nothing in this section shall entitle an adopted child to be paid any 
pension
 or a share in any 
pension

pension
 or share would diminish the 
pension
 or the share of any 
pension
 immediately payable or being paid at the date on which this section comes into operation to the widow or to any child or children by marriage of the

pension
 has on her remarriage lapsed or become payable to the children of her marriage with the

may, if her husband dies in her lifetime, be paid the 
pension
 which was payable to her before her remarriage—

whichever is the later; and
(b)
may, if she becomes entitled on the death of her husband, being a 
member
, to be paid a 
pension
, be paid such 
pension
 till such children cease to be of pensionable age; and may then, without prejudice to any rights under this Act of the children of her marriage with her husband, be paid in lieu the 
pension
 which was payable to her before her remarriage, if that would be to her advantage.

(3)
 of this section, references to the husband of a widow are references to her husband by any remarriage.

, s. 5.]
32. Bankruptcy of widow
Where a 
beneficiary
, being a widow of a 
member
, is adjudged bankrupt or declared insolvent by any competent court, the 
pension
 shall thereupon cease to be payable to her, and, if 
the Board
 so directs, shall lapse:
Provided that, if and so long as 
the Board
 has not directed that the 
pension
 shall lapse, 
the Board
 may during the remainder of her life, or during such shorter period or periods, either continuous or discontinuous, as they think fit, from time to time pay an allowance at a rate not exceeding the rate of such 
pension
 to such widow or to any child or children of her marriage with the 
member
, or in part to the widow and in part to any such child or children; and where the amount of the allowance so paid is less than the amount of the 
pension
 the President may give directions for increasing, in consequence of the reduction under this section of the amount payable out of 
the Fund
, the 
pension
 payable to any child of any other marriage of the 
member
, and such 
pension
 shall be increased accordingly.
33. Certain persons not entitled to 
pension
(1)
No widow of a 
member
 whose marriage with him is contracted after he has either attained the age of fifty-five years or left the 
public service
 and no issue of such marriage shall constitute a 
beneficiary
 for the purposes of this Act or become entitled to 
pension
.
(2)
Where a 
member
 dies within twelve months of his marriage and there is no issue of such marriage, his widow shall not constitute a 
beneficiary
 for the purposes of, or become entitled to any 
pension
 under, this Act:
Provided that 
the Board
 may direct that all or any part of the 
pension
 to which such widow would have been entitled but for the provisions of this subsection  (in this section called the hypothetical 
pension
) shall be paid to her; and where 
the Board
 so directs the widow shall be entitled to payment accordingly and shall constitute a 
beneficiary
 for the purposes of this Act; and, if by virtue of the direction of 
the Board
 part only of the hypothetical 
pension
 becomes payable to such widow, the 
pension
 payable to any other 
beneficiary
 shall be increased by an amount which shall bear to the difference between the 
pension
 which would have been payable to that 
beneficiary
 if 
the Board
 had directed payment of the whole of the hypothetical 
pension
 to the said widow and the 
pension
 which would have been payable to that 
beneficiary
 if 
the Board
 had not given any direction under this subsection, the same proportion as the part of the hypothetical 
pension
 not directed to be paid bears to the whole thereof.
34. Failure to maintain child
If 
the Board
 is satisfied that the widow of a 
member
 while in receipt of a 
pension
 has deserted or abandoned or has failed or is failing to maintain or assist, so far as her means allow, a child of her marriage with the 
member
 whom she is bound by law to maintain and who is of pensionable age, 
the Board
 may, in its uncontrolled discretion, while such child remains of pensionable age, pay or cause to be paid to such child such portion of the 
pension
 as they may think fit and the widow shall have no further claim in respect of any portion of the 
pension
 so paid.
35. Payment of minors’ pensions and widows’ allowances
Any 
pension
 or part of a 
pension
 or any allowance payable under or by virtue of this Act to a minor, and any allowance payable by virtue of this Act to a widow, may, as 
the Board
 may in its uncontrolled discretion from time to time determine, be paid either—
(a)
to such minor or widow; or
(b)
to such person or persons as 
the Board
 may think fit, for, or to be applied for, the maintenance, support, or benefit of the minor or widow.
36. Proof of claim to 
pension
The Board may require such proof as it considers desirable that any person who claims to be entitled to 
pension
, or on behalf of whom such claim is made, is alive and entitled to 
pension
, and the payment of any 
pension
 may be refused until such proof is furnished to the satisfaction of 
the Board
.

Act No. 18 of 1964
, s. 8, 
Act No. 11 of 1971

N.B.—
In these tables, wherever the word “contribution” or “contributions” appears, the reference is both to the members’ contribution or contributions and to the contribution or contributions from public moneys to the credit of each member.
1.
The pension as at the 31st day of March, 1966 (“the original pension”) computed on the tables and instructions in force on that date and registered in respect of each married or widowed officer who began to contribute before, and was still contributing on, the 1st day of April, 1966, shall be recomputed, and increased, as follows—
(a)
The original pension shall be divided into two parts—
X —the part purchased by contributions which fell due on or before the 31st day of March, 1966; and
Y —the part to be purchased by contributions falling due on or after the 1st day of April, 1966.
(b)
Part Y shall be recomputed by applying to Table B in Schedule A the amount of the annual contribution as at the 31st day of March, 1966.
(c)
If Part Y so recomputed is greater than Part Y computed on the tables in force on the 31st day of March, 1966, it shall be added to Part X; otherwise the amount of the original pension shall be retained.
(d)
Each pension so recomputed shall, whether or not the amount of the original pension is retained, be increased by the addition of 40 per cent of Part X.
[For example of recomputation see Section C.]
2.
The pension as at the 31st day of March, 1966, computed on the tables in force on that date and registered in respect of each married or widowed officer who had ceased to contribute on or before that date, but was still alive and ranking for benefit on that date, shall be increased by the addition of 40 per cent of its amount.

See D which gives the method of calculation of quantities not immediately available from the tables.
(c)
Variations of pension consequent on increments to, and decrements from, the annual contribution while the contributor is married to his first wife
Rule I(c)—Multiply the amount of the increment to, or the decrement from, the annual contribution by the quantity found from Table B corresponding to the ages last birthday of the husband and wife at the date of the variation of the contribution.
The product gives the amount to be added to the registered pension consequent on the increment to the annual contribution, or, as the case may be, the amount to be deducted from the registered pension consequent on the decrement from, the annual contribution.
The cessation of the contribution from any cause, except death, before the completion of the full period of contribution must be regarded as a decrement from the annual contribution equal to the amount of such annual contribution.
Example—
* See D which gives the method of calculation of quantities not immediately available from the tables.
II. Second or Subsequent Wife’s Prospective Pension
(a)
Variations of pension consequent on increments to, or decrements from, the annual contribution while the contributor is a widower
Rule II(a)—Assume that the contributors’ last preceding wife was alive at the date of the variation of the contribution and proceed in accordance with Rule I(c).
Example of the application of Rule II(a)—
If the particulars are as in the example subjoined to Rule I(c) except that the first wife, who was born on 5th September, 1994, died on 7th July, 1969, it will be assumed that the contributor was, at the date of each of the three variations of the contribution, married to a wife who was born on 5th September, 1944. The calculations will then be identical with those given in the example subjoined to Rule I(c).
(b)
Variations of pension consequent on the remarriage of the contributor
If the second or subsequent wife was, at the date of the remarriage of the same age last birthday as the last preceding wife would have been had she survived, the registered pension remains the same.
Rule II(b)—If the second or subsequent wife is younger or older than the last preceding wife would have been had she survived, multiply the amount of the pension already registered by the quantity found in Table C corresponding to the age last birthday of the husband at the date of remarriage, and the age last birthday which the last preceding wife would have attained had she survived to that date; multiply the product so obtained by the quantity found from Table A corresponding to the ages last birthday of the husband and of the second or subsequent wife at the date of the remarriage.

See D which gives the method of calculation of quantities not immediately available from the tables.
(c)
Variations of pension consequent on increments to, and decrements from, the annual contribution while the contributor is married to his second or subsequent wife
Rule II(c)—Proceed as in Rule I(c).
B – Contributor with two or more Beneficiaries
Rule III—Where there are children of pensionable age by two or more deceased wives, or where there is a wife and also a child or children of pensionable age by one or more previous marriages, the pension for each beneficiary as found by the above rules must be divided by the total number of beneficiaries then existing to find the registered pension for that beneficiary.
Example—
Assume particulars as in example subjoined to Rules I and II and that on 11th January, 1981, there is a child of pensionable age by the contributor’s first marriage. The pensions as found by the above Asian Officers’ Family Pensions rules would be Sh. 4,939 for the child and Sh. 4,125 for the second wife if each were the sole beneficiary. But there are two beneficiaries and therefore in accordance with Rule III these amounts are to be divided by two. Thus the registered pension will be Sh. 2,470 for the child and Sh. 2,062 for the second wife.
When all the children of the first marriage cease to be of pensionable age, the registered pension for the second wife will be increased to the full amount of Sh.4,125.
C – Example of Recomputation of the Registered Pension of a Married or Widowed Officer who was Contributing on 31st March, 1966
Notes—
(i)
If the recomputed Part Y is smaller than the original Part Y, the original Part Y is retained. The recoomputed registered pension is then the original pension plus 40 per cent of Part X [see instruction 1(c) and 1(d))].
(ii)
If Part Y before recomputation exceeds the registered pension, the recomputed pension is to be the recomputed Part Y.
D – Calculation of Quantities for Ages not given in the Tables
(i)
Ages of husbands and wives younger than the youngest and older than the oldest are to be dealt with as if identical with the youngest and oldest respectively.
(ii)
Quantities relating to ages of wives are given at five-yearly intervals. For the intermediate ages the required quantities are obtained by interpolation.
Examples—
(a)
To find the quantity in Table A corresponding to the ages of a husband and wife aged respectively 27 and 26 last birthday.
The quantity for ages 27 and 25 given in Table A is .401.
The quantity for ages 27 and 30 given in Table A is .471.
The addition of five years to the age of the wife results, therefore, in an addition of .070 to the quantity given in the tables for ages 27 and 25.
An addition of one year to the age of the wife accordingly results, by proportion, in an addition of one-fifth of .070, that is .014. This amount added to .401 gives .415 which is, therefore, the required quantity corresponding to ages 27 and 26.
(b)
Similarly, the quantity found from Table B corresponding to the ages of a husband and wife aged respectively 39 and 38 last birthday is three-fifths of .63 added to 3.21 which gives 3.59.
(c)
To find the quantity in Table C corresponding to the ages of a husband and wife aged respectively 35 and 34 last birthday. It must be noted that in Table C an addition to the age of the wife results in a deduction from the quantity given in the table.
The quantity for ages 35 and 30 given in Table C is 3.29.
The quantity for ages 35 and 35 given in Table C is 2.79.
The addition for five years to the age of the wife results, therefore, in a deduction of .50 from the quantity given in the table for ages 35 and 30.
An addition of four years to the age of the wife accordingly results, by proportion, in a deduction of four-fifths of .50, that is .40. This amount deducted from 3.29 leaves 2.89, which is, therefore, the required quantity corresponding to ages 35 and 34.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCREASING PENSIONS WHICH HAD BECOME PAYABLE BEFORE THE 1ST APRIL, 1966
Every pension which had become payable before 1st April, 1966, shall be increased by the addition of 40 per cent of its amount with effect from that date and the increased pension shall be calculated to the nearest shilling.
