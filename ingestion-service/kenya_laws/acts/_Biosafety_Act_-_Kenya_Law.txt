(a)
risk assessment shall be carried out in a scientifically sound and transparent manner and may take into account expert advice and guiding principles developed by relevant organizations;
(b)
lack of scientific knowledge or scientific consensus shall not necessarily be interpreted to indicate a particular level of risk, an absence of risk or an acceptable risk;

Methodology
To fulfil its objective, a risk assessment shall entail the following steps—
(a)
an identification of any genotype and phenotypic characteristics associated with the genetically modified organisms that may have adverse effects on the environment and on human health;
(b)

an estimation of the overall risk posed by the genetically modified organisms based on the evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of the identified adverse effects being realized;
(e)
a recommendation as to whether or not the risks are acceptable or manageable, including identification of strategies to manage these risks; and
