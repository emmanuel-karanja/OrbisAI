 in an 
approved school of anatomy
, and to 
receive
 for the purpose of such examination, any dead

(3)
Any person who—
(a)
not being a 
licensee
, examines anatomically, or receives for the purpose of anatomical examination, any dead 
body

4. Approval of schools of anatomy

An authority issued under this section shall be issued subject to such conditions as the Minister may think fit, and may be revoked by the Minister at any time.

5. Authority for anatomical examination of dead 
body
(1)
If any person, either in writing signed by him at any time or orally in the presence of two or more witnesses during the illness whereof he died—

has directed that his 
body
 after his death be examined anatomically; or
(b)
has nominated any 
licensee
 to examine his 
body
 anatomically after his death,

, in writing authorize the 
body
 to be examined anatomically or, in the case of a nomination, in writing authorize the 
licensee

body
 being examined anatomically.
(2)
Without prejudice to subsection (1) of this section the person lawfully in possession of the 
body
 of a deceased person (not being an undertaker or other person entrusted with the 
body
 of the person only of its interment or cremation) may, subject to 
section 7
 of this Act, authorize the body to be examined anatomically in an approved school of anatomy unless such person has reason to believe that the deceased had, either in writing signed by him or orally in the presence of two or more witnesses, expressed an objection to his body being examined anatomically after his death, and had not withdrawn it in the like manner, or that the surviving spouse or any relative of the deceased objects to the deceased’s body being examined anatomically.
6. Authority for anatomical examination of 
body
 of person dying in public institution

to authorize the 
body
 of any person who dies in prison, hospital, institution or prison as the case may be, to be examined anatomically in an 
approved school of anatomy
.
(2)
An authority shall not be given under this section if to the knowledge of the person who may give the authority the deceased person has expressed the desire, either in writing signed by him or orally in the presence of two or more witnesses, that his 
body
 after death shall not be examined anatomically or if the surviving spouse or nearest known relative of the deceased person objects to the 
body
 being examined anatomically.
7. Offences where no authority given

(a)
being lawfully in possession of a dead 
body
, delivers up such possession to another person knowing or having reason to believe that it will be examined anatomically, otherwise than as provided in 
section 5
 or 
section 6
 of this Act; or
(b)
receives for anatomical examination, or examines anatomically, any dead 
body
 in respect of which an authority has not been given under 
section 5
 or 
section 6
 of this Act,
shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand shillings or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.
8. No anatomical examination if inquest likely to be required
(1)
Notwithstanding sections 
5
 and 
6
 of this Act, no person shall examine a dead body anatomically, or permit or authorize a dead body to be examined anatomically if he has reason to believe that an inquest, investigation or inquiry into the death may be required to be held under Part XII of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 75).

Any person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand shillings or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.
