Part I – PRELIMINARY
1. These Rules may be cited as the Advocates (Disciplinary Committee) Rules.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
2. In these Rules—
“the Committee” means the Disciplinary Committee;

[L.N. 458/1990.]
Part II – APPLICATION BY ADVOCATE FOR NAME TO BE REMOVED FROM ROLL
3.
(1)
An application to the Committee by an advocate under section 59 of the Act to procure his name to be removed from the Roll shall be made by way of affidavit in Form 1 set out in the Schedule.
(2)
Such affidavit shall be sent to the secretary and a copy thereof to the Council.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
4.
(1)
Unless within fifteen days after receipt of the affidavit, written notice of intention to oppose the same has been given to the secretary, the Committee may decide the application without requiring the attendance of the applicant.
(2)
In any other case, the Committee shall fix a day for the hearing, and the secretary shall give written notice thereof to the applicant and to the Council not less than twenty-one days before the day fixed for the hearing.
(3)
The Committee may, if it thinks fit, require the applicant to give notice of his application and of the day fixed for the hearing, by advertisement or otherwise as it may direct.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
5. If any person other than the Council intends to object to the application at the hearing thereof, he shall give written notice of his intention to the applicant, the Council and the secretary at least seven days before the day fixed for the hearing, specifying the grounds of his objection; and if the Council intends to object to the application it shall cause a similar notice to be given to the applicant and to the secretary.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
6. If, on the hearing of the application, the Committee is of the opinion that grounds exist for a complaint against the applicant under section 60 of the Act, the Committee may refuse the application or adjourn the same sine die pending the making and disposal of a complaint under that section, and may give all such directions with respect thereto as the Committee may deem expedient.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
7. Part IV shall apply 
mutatis mutandis

8. A complaint to the Committee under section 60, or an application to the Committee under section 72, of the Act shall be made by way of affidavit in Form 2 or Form 3 in the Schedule, as the case requires:
Provided that, where a complaint or application is instigated by the Council, such complaint or application may be made on behalf of the Council by the secretary of the Society or by such other person as may be appointed by the Council.

9. An affidavit referring a complaint to the Committee under section 60(2) of the Act shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred shillings.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
10.

[L.N. 458/1990.]
11. If a complaint made to the Committee is dismissed under the proviso to section 60(3) of the Act, the Committee shall, if so required by the complainant or the advocate to whom the complaint relates, make a formal order dismissing the complaint.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
12. In the case of an application in respect of an advocate’s clerk, the clerk shall not be represented before the Committee by any advocate by whom he was employed at the time of the matters which form the subject matter of the application, or by any employee of such an employer.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
13. In the case of a complaint against an advocate, and in the case of an application in respect of an advocate’s clerk, the Committee shall fix a day for the hearing, and the secretary shall give notice thereof to each party to the proceedings not less than twenty-one days before the day fixed for the hearing, and shall at the same time furnish each party, other than the complainant or the applicant, with a copy of the affidavit of complaint or application and of any affidavit in support thereof.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
14. The notice of hearing—
(a)
shall be in Form 4 in the Schedule, and shall, unless the Committee otherwise directs, require the party to whom it is addressed to furnish to the secretary and to every other party, at least fourteen days before the day fixed for the hearing, a list of all documents on which he intends to rely at the hearing; and
(b)
shall set out, in general terms, the charge or charges of professional misconduct made against the advocate, or the grounds of the application in respect of an advocate’s clerk, as the case may be:
Provided that the Committee shall not be precluded from taking into consideration, subject to rule 23, any other charge or ground which may become apparent at the hearing and which fairly arises from the matters set out in the complaint or application.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
15. Any party may inspect and take copies of the documents included in the list furnished by any other party.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
16. Deleted by L.N. 59/2004, s. 2.
17. If any party fails to appear at the hearing, the Committee may, in its discretion, upon proof of service on such party of the notice of hearing, proceed to hear and determine the complaint or application in his absence.
[L.N. 458/1990.]

[L.N. 458/1990.]
19. The Committee may, at any stage of any proceedings refer the case to the Council, which may cause a complaint or a further complaint to be lodged against an advocate or, in case of an application under Part II, may make representations to the committee.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
20. No complaint or application made under Part II or Part III shall be withdrawn after it has been sent to the secretary, except with the leave of the Committee, which may be granted, or refused, upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the Committee thinks fit.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
21. The Committee may of its own motion, or upon the application of any party, adjourn the hearing upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
22. The Committee may, in its discretion and after giving the parties concerned an opportunity to be heard, order the consolidation of the hearing of any proceedings before it.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
23. If, in the course of a hearing, it appears to the Committee that the charges of which notice has been given, or the grounds of an application under section 72 of the Act, require to be amended or added to, the Committee may make or permit such amendment or addition, and the filing of such further affidavit, as it thinks fit, or, if in the opinion of the Committee such amendment or addition is not within the scope of the complaint or application, may require the same to be embodied in a further complaint or application:
Provided that if such amendment or addition is, in the opinion of the Committee such as to take any party by surprise, or prejudice the conduct of his case, the Committee shall grant an adjournment of the hearing upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the Committee thinks fit.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
24. Upon the hearing or determination of any complaint or application, the Committee may, in the case of a complaint against an advocate, without finding any professional misconduct proved against the advocate, or, in the case of an application in respect of an advocate’s clerk, without making any order under section 72 of the Act, nevertheless order any party to pay the costs of proceedings if, having regard to his conduct and to all the circumstances of the case, the Committee so thinks fit.
[L.N. 458/1990.]
25. The Chairman of the Committee shall take or cause to be taken a note of all proceedings before the Committee, or may order that the record of any proceedings before it shall be taken by shorthand note.
