35. Liquidation of insolvent institutions
(1)
If satisfied on reasonable grounds that an 
institution
 has become insolvent, 
the Central Bank
 may appoint the 
Board
 to be a liquidator of the 
institution
.
(2)
Such an appointment has the same effect as the appointment of a liquidator by the High Court under Part VI of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
), and for that purpose, references in that Act to "the relevant date" and "commencement of the liquidation" are taken to be references to the date on which the Board is appointed as liquidator.
(3)
A person may not be appointed as liquidator of an 
institution
 under Part VI of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
)—
(a)
if the 
Board
 has already been appointed as its liquidator; or
(b)
if the 
Board
 has not already been so appointed without the approval of the High Court.
(4)
The Court may give approval under subsection 
(3)(b)
 only if 
the Central Bank
—

has certified that it does not intend to exercise its powers under this section; or
(b)
has failed to exercise its powers within such period, not exceeding three months, as the High Court may specify.
(5)
When a liquidator (other than the 
Board
) has been appointed as liquidator of an 
institution
, 
the Central Bank
 may, at any time, apply to the High Court for an order that the liquidator be removed and the 
Board
 be appointed as liquidator instead.
(6)
If the High Court appoints the 
Board
 instead of the liquidator, the provisions of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
), apply to a liquidation by the Board but only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this Act and any regulations made under it.
(7)
When the 
Board
 is appointed as liquidator of an 
institution
, it may do all or any of the following—
(a)
carry on the business of the 
institution
 so far as may be necessary for its beneficial liquidation;

institution
 and a contributory or other person who may have a liability to the 
institution
; and
(ii)
all questions affecting the assets or liquidation of the 
institution
,
on such terms as may be agreed;
(f)
take security for the discharge of any such call, debt, liability or claim and give a complete discharge for it.

institution

recover interest payable to the 
institution
 on loans, overdrafts and other credit facilities outstanding as at the date of liquidation;
(c)
offset deposits and any other liabilities to the 
institution
's customers against any loans or debts owed to the 
institution
 as at the date of liquidation;
(d)
invest surplus funds in the liquidation account that are not immediately required for the purpose of financing day to day operations in short-term placements with reputable institutions approved by the 
Board
 or in such Government securities as the 
Board
 may determine.
(9)
In the exercise of its powers as a liquidator, the 
Board
 may, by notice in writing, require any person who is or has at any time been a director, managing director, secretary, principal 
officer
, manager, 
officer
 or employee, agent, accountant or auditor of the 
institution
 or any person who has custody of any funds or other assets of the 
institution
 being liquidated to—
(a)
give to the liquidator all reasonable assistance in connection with the liquidation;
(b)
appear before the liquidator for examination concerning matters relevant to the liquidation;
(c)
produce any records or documents that relate to the affairs of the 
institution
 being liquidated.
(10)
In performing its functions under this section, the 
Board
 is subject to the supervision of 
the Central Bank
.
(11)
When the 
Board
 has been appointed as liquidator in respect of an 
institution
, the powers of the 
Board
 are exercisable only if and to the extent authorised by 
the Central Bank
.
(12)
When the High Court has appointed a liquidator in respect of an 
institution
, the powers of the liquidator are exercisable only if and to the extent authorised by the High Court.
(13)
On the application of any interested party, the High Court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, appoint a liquidation committee having the same powers as a liquidation committee appointed under Part VI of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
).
(14)
The 
Cabinet Secretary
 may make regulations generally for carrying out the liquidation of an 
institution
 under this section, and in doing so may—
(a)
apply relevant provisions of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
), with or without modifications; and
(b)
include provision as to the manner and time in which depositors and other creditors of the 
institution
 (preferential or otherwise) are required to submit proofs of their debts to the 
Board
.
(15)
For the purpose of this section, an 
institution
 becomes insolvent if—
(a)
it is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 
383
 of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
);
(b)
a liquidation order is made against it, or a resolution for creditors' voluntary liquidation is passed, under Part VI of the Insolvency Act (

[Repealed by Act 
No. 14 of 2015

35B. Power to place institutions in administration in certain circumstances
(1)
The Central Bank may appoint the 
Board
 as administrator to manage to manage the 
institution
's affairs and property, but only it is satisfied that—
(a)
the 
institution
 is or is, likely to become unable to pay its debts; and
(b)
the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve at least one of the objectives of administration.
(2)
For the purpose of subsection 
(1)(b)
, the objectives of administration are the following—
(a)
to maintain the 
institution
 as a going concern;
(b)
to achieve a better outcome for the 
institution
's creditors as a whole than would likely to be the case if the 
institution
 were liquidated (without first being under administration);
(c)
to realise the property of the 
institution
 in order to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors.
(3)
The appointment of the 
Board
 as administrator of an 
institution
 has the same effect as the appointment by the High Court of an administrator of a company under Division 3 of Part VIII of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
).
(4)
A person may not be appointed as administrator of an 
institution
 under Part VIII of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
)—
(a)
if the 
Board
 has already been appointed as its administrator; or
(b)
if the 
Board
 has not already been so appointed without the approval of the High Court.
(5)
The Court may give approval under subsection 
(4)(b)
 only if 
the Central Bank
—

has certified that it does not intend to exercise its powers under this section; or

has failed to exercise its powers within such period, not exceeding three months, as the High Court may specify.
(6)
When an administrator (other than the 
Board
) has been appointed in respect of an 
institution
, 
the Central Bank
 may, at any time, apply to the High Court for an order that the administrator be removed and the 
Board
 be appointed as administrator instead.
(7)
If the High Court removes the administrator and appoints the 
Board
 instead, the provisions of Part VIII of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
), apply to an administration by the Board but only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this Act and any regulations made under it.
(8)
A receiver or receiver and manager may not be appointed in respect of an 
institution
 and any provision purporting to confer power to appoint such a receiver or a receiver and manager is taken to be a power to appoint an administrator under Part VIII of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
).
(9)
If, before the commencement of the Companies and Insolvency Legislation (Consequential Amendments) Act, a receiver or receiver and manager of an 
institution
 has been appointed in respect of an 
institution
, the receiver, or receiver and manager, is taken to be an administrator appointed under Part VIII of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
).
(10)
When the 
Board
 is appointed as administrator in respect of an 
institution
 are exercisable only if and to the extent authorised by 
the Central Bank
.
(11)
The powers of an administrator (other than the 
Board
) appointed or taken to have been appointed in respect of an 
institution
 are exercisable only if and to the extent authorised by the High Court.
(12)
In the exercise of its powers as an administrator, the 
Board
 may, by notice in writing, require a person to whom subsection 
(13)
 applies—
(a)
to give to the liquidator all reasonable assistance in connection with the administration;
(b)
to appear before the 
Board
 for examination concerning matters relevant to the administration;
(c)
to produce any records or documents that relate to the affairs of the 
institution
 under administration.
(13)
This subsection applies to the following persons—
(a)
any person who is or has at any time been a director, managing director, secretary, principal 
officer
, manager, 
officer
 or employee, agent, accountant or auditor of the 
institution
;
(b)
any person who has custody of funds or other assets of the 
institution
 under administration.
(14)
The 
Cabinet Secretary
 may make regulations generally for carrying out the administration of an 
institution
 under this section, and in doing so may apply relevant provisions of the Insolvency Act (
Cap. 53
), with or without modifications.
[Act 
No. 19 of 2015
, s. 84.]
35C. Right of appeal in respect of 
Board
's exercise of powers under section 
35

Any interested person who is dissatisfied with the exercise by the 
Board
 of a power conferred on it by section 
35
 may apply to the High Court for an order or orders under subsection 
(2)
.

On the hearing of an application made under subsection 
(1)
, the High Court may either dismiss the application or, if it considers that that the 
Board
 has exercised the power unfairly or unreasonably in relation to the applicant, make either or both of the following orders—
(a)
an order quashing any decision of the 
Board
 purporting to be made in the exercise of the power, and any action taken as a result of that decision;
(b)
an order directing the 
Board
 to exercise the power in such a way as the Court determines, subject to such terms as the Court considers appropriate.
(3)
The 
Board
 is entitled to be served with a copy of an application made under subsection 
(1)
 and to appear as respondent at the hearing of the application.
[Act 
No. 19 of 2015
, s. 84.]
35D. Offences under sections 
35
 and 
35B
(1)
A person who—
(a)
refuses or fails to comply with a requirement of a liquidator appointed under 
section 35
, or of an administrator appointed under 
section 35B
, that is applicable to the person, to the extent to which the person is able to comply with it;
(b)
obstructs or hinders such a liquidator or administrator in the exercise of the powers conferred under this Act;
(c)
provides information, or makes a false statement, to such a liquidator or administrator knowing it to be false or misleading in any material respect; or
