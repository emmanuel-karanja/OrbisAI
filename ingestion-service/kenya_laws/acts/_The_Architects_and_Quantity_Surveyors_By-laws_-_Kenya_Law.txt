FOURTH SCHEDULE
CONDITIONS OF ENGAGEMENT AND SCALE OF PROFESSIONAL CHARGES FOR ARCHITECTS
[By-law 38, L.N. 18/1962, s. 4, L.N. 122/1968, s. 2, L.N. 193/1979, s. 2.]
PART 1 - CONDITIONS OF ENGAGEMENT
A.1 Responsibilities
(a)
Architects in Kenya are governed by the Architects and Quantity Surveyors Act (
Cap. 525
) and by the by-laws made thereunder.
(b)
The work of an architect is to advise his clients, study their needs, to prepare, direct and co-ordinate design and to supervise works executed under a building contract.
(c)
The employment of consultants shall be at the architect’s discretion in agreement with the client. Where consultants are employed, the architect shall be responsible for the direction and integration of their work. Consultants shall be responsible for the detailed design and supervision of the work entrusted to them.
(d)
The architect may also nominate specialist sub-contractors for the design and execution of any part of the work. He shall be responsible for the direction and integration of their design, and for the supervision of their work in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause.
(e)
The work done by an architect in fulfilment of these responsibilities is described in Part 3 of this Schedule.
(f)
The architect shall not initiate or proceed with any stage of his duties without the authority of the client. He shall not make any material deviation, alteration, addition to or omission from the approved design without the knowledge and consent of the client, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause.
He shall inform the client if the total authorized expenditure is likely to be exceeded and if the contract period is likely to be varied.
(g)
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this clause, the architect may authorize material changes in design if they are necessary for constructional reasons, provided that the client is informed without delay.
(h)
The architect shall give such periodic supervision and inspection as may be necessary to ensure that the works are being executed in general accordance with the contract; constant supervision does not form part of his normal duties.
(i)
Where more frequent or constant inspection is required a Clerk of Works shall be employed. He shall be nominated or approved by the architect, and be under the architect’s direction and control. He shall be appointed and paid by the client or alternatively may be employed by the architect who shall be reimbursed in accordance with paragraph (a) of clause H.4 of this Schedule.
(j)
Where the employment of a resident architect is agreed he shall be employed by the architect who shall be reimbursed in accordance with paragraph (a) of clause H.4 of this Schedule.
A.2 Remuneration
(a)
Architects in Kenya are required to uphold and apply the Scale of Professional Charges published by the Board. The remuneration of the architect shall therefore be in accordance with the Scale and Conditions specified herein, unless a higher charge is agreed between the architect and client when the former is commissioned.
(b)
The Scale of Charges does not include any remuneration for works performed by Quantity Surveyors, or by Civil, Structural, Electrical or Heating and Ventilating Engineers, or for any other work normally performed by specialist consultants. Where any work which would normally be performed by a specialist consultant is performed by the architect’s own staff, other than work provided for in Part 6 of this Schedule, then subject to prior agreement by the client, a fee shall be charged in accordance with the Scales of Fees of the Association of Consulting Engineers or other appropriate Professional Association.
(c)
When consultants are employed, subject to paragraph (c) of clause A.1, they may be appointed and paid by the architect, who shall be reimbursed by the client for such payments, or appointed and paid by the client.
(d)
Where work done by a client results in the omission of part of the normal service described in Part 3 of this Schedule, a commensurate reduction in fees may be made by prior written agreement, provided such an agreement schedules in detail the work to be done by the client which would otherwise have formed part of the normal service by the architect.
(e)
The architect’s charges do not include any remuneration for quantity surveying.
(f)
Where the services of more than one profession are provided by a single firm or consortium, fees shall be the same as if such services were provided independently. Any consolidated fees shall therefore be the sum of the appropriate fees for the individual professional services rendered.
(g)
Where an architect is commissioned by the Government of Kenya to undertake professional work in accordance with the special Scale of Charges agreed between Government and the Profession, the architect shall not be bound to adhere to the Scale specified herein, except in regard to any matter not described in the said special Scale.
A.3 Termination of Engagement
(a)
An engagement entered into between the architect and the client may be terminated at any time by either party on the expiry of reasonable notice, when the architect shall be entitled to remuneration in accordance with clause B.10 of this Schedule.
A.4 Copyright
(a)
Copyright in all drawings and in the work executed from them will remain the property of the architect unless a specific contract is entered into for the sale of such a copyright and except for drawings and work for the Government of the Republic of Kenya as provided for in section 6 of the Copyright Act (
Cap. 130
).
A.5 Interpretation
(a)
Any question arising out of the Conditions of Engagement and Scale of Professional Fees and Charges may be referred by architect or client to the Board for advice at any time, provided always that any difference or dispute between them shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of clause A.6 or clause A.7 of this Schedule.
A.6 Disputes
(a)
Any difference or dispute may by agreement between the parties be referred to the Board for an opinion, provided always that such an opinion is sought on a joint statement of undisputed facts, and the parties undertake to accept it as final.
A.7 Arbitration
(a)
Where any difference or dispute arising out of the Conditions of Engagement and Scale of Professional Fees and Charges cannot be determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of clause A.6, it shall be referred to arbitration by a person to be agreed between the parties, or failing agreement within fourteen days after either party has given the other a written request to concur in the appointment of an arbitrator, to a person to be nominated at the request of either party by the President of the East Africa Institute of Architects.
PART 2 - THE CALCULATION OF FEES AND CHARGES
B.1 This part first sets out the various kinds of fees and charges, and then deals with the details of their calculation. It may prove convenient to turn to Part 3 of this Schedule after reading clause B.2, and to refer back to the remaining clauses in Part 2 of this Schedule.
B.2 Scope
(a)
The architect’s fees and charges may fall into four main categories.
B.3 "The Normal Service"
Fees for work common to all building projects, which is described in Part 3 of this Schedule and hereinafter referred to as the normal service. Such fees are a percentage of the total construction cost of the works as hereinafter defined. As described in Part 4 of this Schedule, the percentage may vary according to the nature of the works.
B.4 "Additional Services"
Fees for work which although common to many building projects does not necessarily arise in all, or which is so variable that it could not reasonably be charged on a percentage basis. Such work is described in Part 5 of this Schedule and is hereinafter referred to as additional services. The architect’s fees for this work are on a time basis in accordance with Part 7 of this Schedule.
B.5 "Special Services"
Fees for specialist work, such as is described in Part 6 of this Schedule and hereinafter referred to as special services, which may arise in any building project. Such fees may be a percentage of the cost of executing the specialist works for which the architect is engaged, which will vary according to the nature of the services, or on a time basis in accordance with Part 7 of this Schedule.
B.6 "Out of Pocket Expenses"
The cost of all prints, and other reproductions of all drawings and documents, travelling and hotel expenses, and other reasonable disbursements which are specifically incurred in connection with the commission, which shall be charged in accordance with Part 8 of this Schedule.
B.7 Total Construction Costs
(a)
The total construction cost will be based on the cost, as certified by the architect, of all works executed under the direction of the general contractor, including the cost of site works and built-in furniture and equipment, subject to the following conditions:
(b)
The total construction cost should not include sub-contractor’s design fees for work on which consultants would otherwise have been employed. Where appropriate the architect should estimate a reduction from the contract sum.
(c)
In addition to the cost of all works executed under the building contract, the total construction cost shall be deemed to include the cost of any work which is excluded from the contract but otherwise designed by the architect.
(d)
The cost of specialist equipment, fixed or unfixed, of works of art will not usually be included, although the architect may charge for work in connexion with such items under Part 6 of this Schedule, or on a time basis as provided for under Part 7 of this Schedule.
(e)
Where appropriate the cost of old materials will be calculated as if they were new.
(f)
Where any materials, labour or carriage are supplied by a client who is not the builder, the cost shall be estimated by the architect as if they were supplied by the contractor, and included in the total construction cost.
(g)
Where the client is the builder, the building organization’s own estimated cost of the works, as certified by an independent quantity surveyor, may be used in calculating the total construction cost provided always that the architect’s own estimate shall be used in the absence of such statement of account.
B.8 The Normal Service
(a)
The work described in Part 3 of this Schedule is required for any building project and unless the architect is specifically informed to the contrary he may assume the client intends the execution of any works he is commissioned to design, and that the normal service will be required.
(b)
The normal service is divided into five stages described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of clause C.2. Subject to the provisions of clause B.10, percentage fees on the total construction cost of the works shall be charged for services provided in paragraphs (b) to (e) of clause C.2.
B.9 Mode and Time of Payment
(a)
On completion of each stage of the normal service described in Part 3 of this Schedule, the appropriate percentage fee on the estimated construction cost of the works subject to any variation in accordance with Part 4 of this Schedule, plus any other fees and out of pocket expenses which have accrued, shall be due for payment.
(b)
Fees and charges in respect of stages described in paragraphs (d) and
(e)
of clause C.2 will be paid by instalments proportionate to the drawings completed or value of the works certified from time to time.
(c)
Alternatively, the architect and client may arrange for interim payments of fees and charges during all stages of the work and for payment during the stage described in paragraph (e) of clause C.2 by instalments other than those related to the value of the work certified from time to time.
(d)
On the issue of the final certificate, all percentage fees must be recalculated on the actual construction cost. The final instalment of all fees and other charges must then be made.
B.10 Partial Service
(a)
Where for any reason the architect provides only part of the service described in Part 3 of this Schedule he shall be entitled to commensurate remuneration, in addition to any out of pocket expenses, in accordance with paragraphs (b) to (f) of this clause, clause B.11 and clause B.12 of this Schedule.
(b)
Where an architect completes the work in any of paragraphs (b) to (d) of clause C.2, he shall be entitled to the appropriate percentage fee on the estimated construction cost of the works.
(c)
Where an architect is commissioned to undertake only the work described in paragraph (e) of clause C.2, whether in whole or part, fees shall be on a time basis; provided always that where the architect provides only part of the services described in paragraph (e) of clause C.2 in respect of his own design he shall be entitled to net less than the percentage fee due to him under paragraph (b) of clause B.9.
(d)
Where an architect provides only a part of the complete service described in any of paragraphs (b) to (d) of clause C.2, fees shall be on a time basis, except by prior written agreement in accordance with paragraph (d) of clause A.2.
(e)
All percentage fees for partial services shall be based on the architect’s current estimate of the total construction cost of the work. Such estimates may be based on an accepted tender, or subject to paragraph (f) of this clause, on the lowest of unaccepted tenders.
(f)
In no case where partial service is provided in respect of works for which the executed cost is not known and no tender has been accepted should the architect’s percentage fees be based on an estimated total construction cost which exceeds the most recent cost limit agreed with the client.
B.11 Abandoned Works
(a)
Where the construction of works is cancelled or postponed for a period exceeding twelve months, or the architect is instructed to stop work indefinitely at any time they shall be deemed to be abandoned and fees for partial service will be due.
(b)
If, however, instructions necessary for the architect to continue work are not received from the client, the works may be deemed to have been abandoned after six months have elapsed from the time such instructions were requested.
(c)
Where works are abandoned or any part of them is omitted at any time before completion, fees for partial service in respect of the whole or part of the works shall be charged for all work done with due authority, in accordance with clause B.10 of this Schedule.
B.12 Resumed Works
(a)
If works which have been abandoned are resumed without substantial alteration within twelve months any fees paid under clause B.11 of this Schedule shall rank solely as payment on account towards the total fee payable on the execution of such works and calculated on their total construction cost.
(b)
Except where there is written agreement to the contrary, where works which have been abandoned are resumed after twelve months, any fees paid under clause B.11 of this Schedule shall be regarded as final payment for the services originally rendered. The resumed works shall be deemed a new commission for which payment shall be due in accordance with Part 3 and clause B.10 of this Schedule.
(c)
All additional work arising out of resumed works shall be charged on a time basis.
PART 3 - THE NORMAL SERVICE
C.1 The minimum fee for normal service is 6 per cent for new works and 10 per cent for works to existing buildings. Higher percentages scheduled in clauses D.2 and D.3 apply to works costing less than £7,000. The normal service is divided into stages which mark the progress of the architect’s work. On completion of each stage an instalment of the fee is payable in accordance with clause B.9 of this Schedule.

(e)
The percentage in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause are minimal and will not necessarily be sufficient for alterations to all buildings. Higher fees may often be appropriate and should be assessed on the merits of the individual commission.
D.4 Repetitive Works
(a)
Repetitive works may consist of floors or bays repeated within a single building, or buildings repeated on the same site. Where such floor, bays or buildings are repeated under a single building contract and such repetition enables sets of drawings and specifications to be re-used without alteration or with only minor modifications, fees shall be reduced as follows:
(b)
Where houses are in all respects identical repeats of one design for which type drawings and specifications can be re-used without modification, the fees for work described in paragraph (c) of clause C.2 shall be reduced by 1 per cent, and the fees for work described in paragraph (d) of clause C.2 shall be waived for each repeated house other than the first five.
(c)
Fees for work described in paragraph (d) of clause C.2 only shall be waived for each repeated house, other than the first five, for which type drawings and specifications can be re-used with only minor modification.
(d)
Where a multi-storey building contains a number of repeated floors or a single building consists of a number of repeated bays which are each not less than 2,500 square feet in area and are in all respects repetitions of a single design for which type drawings and specifications can be re-used without modification, fees for services described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of clause C.2 shall be waived for each repeated floor or bay, other than the first eight floor or the first five bays.
(e)
Fees for work described in paragraph (d) of clause C.2 only may be waived for each repeated floor or bay, other than the first eight floors or five bays, for which type drawings and specifications can be re-used with only minor modifications, provided that all the conditions in paragraph (d) of this clause are fulfilled.
(f)
Where a multi-storey building consists of two or more self-contained units, each of which consists of a number of dwellings and their ancillary facilities including all necessary access, fees for the repeated units shall be calculated as if they were independent buildings, in accordance with clause D.5.
(g)
The calculation of fees for repetitive works shall be in accordance with clause D.6.
D.5 Repeated Buildings
(a)
Where a building is repeated for the same client, and type drawings and specifications can be re-used without modification, irrespective of whether more than one site or contract is involved, fees shall be reduced as follows:
(b)
Where a building of not less than 2,000 square feet in area is in all respects a repeat of a previous design for the same client and type drawings and specifications can be re-used without modification, the fees for work described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of clause C.2 shall be waived for each repeated building other than the first.
(c)
Fees for work described in paragraph (d) of clause C.2 only may be waived for each repeated building of not less than 2,000 square feet in area, other than the first, for which type drawings and specifications can be re-used with only minor modification.
(d)
Fees for all except the first five of any repeated buildings of less than 2,000 square feet in area may be waived for work described in paragraph (c) and/
or (d) of clause C.2 provided that all the conditions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause respectively are fulfilled.
(e)
The calculation of fees for repeated buildings shall be in accordance with clause D.6.
D.6 Application of Reductions
(a)
Reduction for repetitive work and repeated buildings shall be calculated as follows:
(b)
Type drawings and specifications are those drawings of a repeated house, floor, bay or unit of a building which are necessary for the construction of the works above ground floor slab, otherwise referred to as the superstructure.
Reductions shall be made in respect of superstructure only, and all work below ground floor slabs or timber joists shall be excluded from all construction costs on which stage fees are waived.
(c)
The total construction cost of the work shall be taken first and the fee for normal or partial services calculated thereon. The fee for any work in paragraphs (c) and/or (d) of clause C.2 which is done should then be assessed on the cost of the works qualifying for reductions and deducted from the fee first calculated.
(d)
Screen walls, outbuildings and garages shall be excluded from the construction costs of works on which fees are waived unless they are included in the type drawings and specifications.
(e)
The "handing" of a plan shall not constitute a modification.
(f)
The fees for work in paragraph (e) of clause C.2 shall not in any circumstances be reduced for repetitive works or repeated buildings.
(g)
In the case of houses which are in all respects repeats of one design but for which separate applications for approval must be made to the local authority for each house, then paragraph (c) of clause D.4 and not paragraph (b) of clause D.4 shall apply.
PART 5 - ADDITIONAL SERVICES
E.1 This section covers services which although common to many building projects do not necessarily arise in all, or which are so variable that they could not reasonably be charged on a percentage basis.
(a)
The architect’s charges for the services described will be based on the time spent on the work by the architect and his staff.
E.2 Sites and Buildings
(a)
For advising on the selection and suitability of sites, conducting negotiations concerned with sites or buildings, making surveys, measurements and plans of the sites, sites and buildings or existing buildings.
(b)

(c)
For preparing schedules of dilapidations and negotiating them on behalf of landlords or tenants; for taking particulars on site, preparing specifications for repairs and supervising their execution.
(d)
For making structural investigations, the limits of which shall be clearly defined and agreed in writing, such as are necessary to ascertain or not whether there are defects in the walls, roof, floors and drains of a building which may materially affect its life and value.
E.3 Feasibility Studies
(a)
For undertaking a preliminary technical appraisal of a project sufficient to enable the client to decide whether and in what form to proceed, and making town planning inquiries or application for outline town planning approval. Such an appraisal may include an approximation of the cost of meeting the client’s requirements, a statement upon the need for consultants, an outline timetable and a suggested contract procedure.
E.4 Development Plans
(a)
For preparing development plans which will be carried out over a number of years for any large building or complex of buildings.
(b)
Fees for preparing development plans shall always be additional to percentage fees for normal service.
