An Act of Parliament to repeal and re-enact with amendments the Arbitration Act and to provide for connected purposes
Part I – PRELIMINARY
1. Short title
This Act may be cited as the Arbitration Act.
2. Application
Except as otherwise provided in a particular case, the provisions of this Act shall apply to domestic 
arbitration
 and international 
arbitration
.
3. Interpretation
(1)
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires—
"arbitration" means any arbitration whether or not administered by a permanent arbitral institution;
"arbitration agreement" means an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not;
"arbitral award" means any award of an arbitral tribunal and includes an interim arbitral award;
"arbitral tribunal" means a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators;
"party" means a party to an arbitration agreement and includes a person claiming through or under a party.
(2)
An arbitration is domestic if the arbitration agreement provides expressly or by implication for arbitration in Kenya: and at the time when proceedings are commenced or the arbitration is entered into—
(a)
where the arbitration is between individuals, the parties are nationals of Kenya or are habitually resident in Kenya;
(b)
where the arbitration is between bodies corporate, the parties are incorporated in Kenya or their central management and control are exercised in Kenya;
(c)
where the arbitration is between an individual and a body corporate—
(i)
the party who is an individual is a national of Kenya or is habitually resident in Kenya; and
(ii)
the party that is a body corporate is incorporated in Kenya or its central management and control are exercised in Kenya; or
(d)
the place where a substantial part of the obligations of the commercial relationship is to be performed, or the place with which the subject- matter of the dispute is most closely connected, is Kenya.
(3)
An arbitration is international if—
(a)
the parties to an arbitration agreement have, at the time of the conclusion of that agreement, their places of business in different states;
(b)
one of the following places is situated outside the state in which the parties have their places of business—
(i)
the juridical seat of arbitration is determined by or pursuant to the arbitration agreement; or
(ii)
any place where a substantial part of the obligations of the commercial relationship is to be performed or the place with which the subject-matter of the dispute is most closely connected; or
(c)
the parties have expressly agreed that the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement relates to more than one state.
(4)
For the purpose of subsection (3)—
(a)
if a party has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the arbitration agreement; and
(b)
if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to his habitual residence.
(5)
Where a provision of this Act, except 
section 29
 leaves the parties free to determine a certain issue, such freedom includes the right of the parties to authorize a third party including an institution to make that determination.
(6)
Where a provision of this Act refers to the fact that the parties have agreed or that they may agree or in any other way refer to an agreement of the parties, such agreement includes any arbitration rules referred to in that agreement.
(7)
Where a provision of this Act, other than sections 
26
 and 
33
(2)(a), refers to a claim, it also applies to a counterclaim, and where it refers to a defence it also applies to a defence to such counterclaim.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 2.]
Part II – GENERAL PROVISIONS
4. Form of arbitration agreement
(1)
An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.
(2)
An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.
(3)
An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in—
(a)
a document signed by the parties;
(b)
an exchange of letters, telex, telegram, facsimile, electronic mail or other means of telecommunications which provide a record of the agreement; or
(c)
an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other party.
(4)
The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause shall constitute an arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to make that arbitration clause part of the contract.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 3.]
5. Waiver of right to object
A 
party
 who knows that any provision of this Act from which the parties may derogate or any requirement under the 
arbitration agreement
 has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the 
arbitration
 without stating his objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is prescribed, within such period of time, is deemed to have waived the right to object.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 4.]
6. Stay of legal proceedings
(1)
A court before which proceedings are brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so applies not later than the time when that party enters appearance or otherwise acknowledges the claim against which the stay of proceedings is sought, stay the proceedings and refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds—
(a)
that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed; or
(b)
that there is not in fact any dispute between the parties with regard to the matters agreed to be referred to arbitration.
(2)
Proceedings before the court shall not be continued after an application under subsection (1) has been made and the matter remains undetermined.
(3)
If the court declines to stay legal proceedings, any provision of the arbitration agreement to the effect that an award is a condition precedent to the bringing of legal proceedings in respect of any matter is of no effect in relation to those proceedings.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 5.]
7. Interim measures by court
(1)
It is not incompatible with an 
arbitration agreement
 for a 
party
 to request from the High Court, before or during arbitral proceedings, an interim measure of protection and for the High Court to grant that measure.
(2)
Where a 
party
 applies to the High Court for an injunction or other interim order and the 
arbitral tribunal
 has already ruled on any matter relevant to the application, the High Court shall treat the ruling or any finding of fact made in the course of the ruling as conclusive for the purposes of the application.
8. Death of a 
party
(1)
An 
arbitration agreement
 is not discharged by the death of any 
party
 thereto, either as respects the deceased or any other 
party
, but in such event is enforceable by or against the personal representative of the deceased.
(2)
The authority of an arbitrator is not revoked by the death of any 
party
 by whom he was appointed.
(3)
Nothing in this section affects the operation of any law by virtue of which any right of action is extinguished by the death of a person.
9. Receipt of written communications
(1)
Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties any communication made pursuant to or for the purposes of an 
arbitration agreement
—
(a)
being a communication effected by facsimile or electronic mail—
(i)
is deemed to have been received if it is transmitted to a facsimile number or electronic mailing address, as the case may be, specified by the addressee as his number or address for service; and
(ii)
is deemed to have been received on the day on which it is so transmitted; or
(b)
in any other case—
(i)
is deemed to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it is delivered at his place of business, habitual residence or mailing address; and
(ii)
is deemed to have been received on the day on which it was so delivered.
(2)
Where, after reasonable inquiry, a place of business or residential address specified by the addressee cannot be found, or where such a place or address, or any mailing address, facsimile number or electronic mailing address so specified appears never to have been, or to be no longer, that of the addressee, a written communication—
(a)
is deemed to have been received if it is sent to the addressee’s last known place of business, residential address or mailing address, or last known facsimile number or electronic mailing address, or by any other means that provides a record of the attempt to deliver or transmit the communication; and
(b)
is deemed to have been received on the date specified in that record.
(3)
This section does not apply to the service of documents for the purpose of legal proceedings for which provision is made by rules of court.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 6.]
10. Extent of court intervention
Except as provided in this Act, no court shall intervene in matters governed by this Act.

11. Determination of number of arbitrators
(1)
The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators.
(2)
Failing such determination, the number of arbitrators shall be one.
(3)
Where an 
arbitration agreement
 provides that the reference shall be to two arbitrators, then, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the agreement, the agreement is deemed to include a provision that the two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator immediately after they are themselves appointed.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 7.]
12. Appointment of arbitrators
(1)
No person shall be precluded by reason of that person’s nationality from acting as an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
(2)
The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators and any chairman and failing such agreement—
(a)
in an 
arbitration
 with three arbitrators, each 
party
 shall appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed shall appoint the arbitrator;
(b)
in an 
arbitration
 with two arbitrators, each 
party
 shall appoint one arbitrator; and
(c)
in an 
arbitration
 with one arbitrator, the parties shall agree on the arbitrator to be appointed.
(3)
Unless the parties otherwise agree, where each of two parties to an 
arbitration agreement
 is to appoint an arbitrator and one 
party
 ("the 
party
 in default")—
(a)
has indicated that he is unwilling to do so;
(b)
fails to do so within the time allowed under the 
arbitration agreement
; or
(c)
fails to do so within fourteen days (where the 
arbitration agreement
 does not limit the time within which an arbitrator must be appointed by a 
party
), the other 
party
, having duly appointed an arbitrator, may give notice in writing to the 
party
 in default that he proposes to appoint his arbitrator to act as sole arbitrator.
(4)
If the 
party
 in default does not, within fourteen days after notice under subsection (3) has been given —
(a)
make the required appointment; and
(b)
notify the other 
party
 that he has done so, the other 
party
 may appoint his arbitrator as sole arbitrator, and the award of that arbitrator shall be binding on both parties as if he had been so appointed by agreement.
(5)
Where a sole arbitrator has been appointed under subsection (4), the 
party
 in default may, upon notice to the other 
party
, apply to the High Court within fourteen days to have the appointment set aside.
(6)
The High Court may grant an application under subsection (5) only if it is satisfied that there was good cause for the failure or refusal of the 
party
 in default to appoint his arbitrator in due time.
(7)
The High Court, if it grants an application under subsection (5), may, by consent of the parties or on the application of either 
party
, appoint a sole arbitrator.
(8)
A decision of the High Court in respect of a matter under this section shall be final and not be subject to appeal.
(9)
The High Court in appointing an arbitrator shall have due regard to any qualifications required of an arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator and, in the case of a sole or third arbitrator, shall take into account the advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than those of the parties.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 8.]
13. Grounds for challenge
(1)
When a person is approached in connection with his possible appointment as an arbitrator, he shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence.
(2)
From the time of his appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, an arbitrator shall without delay disclose any such circumstances to the parties unless the parties have already been informed of them by him.
(3)
An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality and independence, or if he does not possess qualifications agreed to by the parties or if he is physically or mentally incapable of conducting the proceedings or there are justifiable doubts as to his capacity to do so.
(4)
A 
party
 may challenge an arbitrator appointed by him, or in whose appointment that 
party
 has participated, only for reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 9.]
14. Challenge procedure
(1)
Subject to subsection (3), the parties are free to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator.

section 13
 (3), send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal, and unless the arbitrator who is being challenged withdraws from his office or the other party agrees to the challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge.
(3)
If a challenge under agreed procedure or under subsection (2) is unsuccessful, the challenging party may, within thirty days after being notified of the decision to reject the challenge, apply to the High Court to determine the matter.
(4)
On an application under subsection (3), the arbitrator who was challenged shall be entitled to appear and be heard before the High Court determines the application.
(5)
The High Court may confirm the rejection of the challenge or may uphold the challenge and remove the arbitrator.
(6)
The decision of the High Court on such an application shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal.
(7)
Where an arbitrator is removed by the High Court under this section, the court may make such order as it thinks fit with respect to his entitlement (if any) to fees or expenses or the repayment of any fees or expenses already paid.
(8)
While an application under subsection (3) is pending before the High Court, the parties may commence, continue and conclude arbitral proceedings, but no award in such proceedings shall take effect until the application is decided, and such an award shall be void if the application is successful.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 10.]

he withdraws from his office; or
(c)
the parties agree in writing to the termination of the mandate.
(2)
If there is any dispute concerning any of the grounds referred to in subsection (1)(a), a 
party
 may apply to the High Court to decide on the termination of the mandate.
(3)
A decision of the High Court under subsection (2) shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal.
(4)
Where under this section or 
section 14
(2), an arbitrator withdraws from his office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, that shall not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this section or 
section 16
(3).
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 11.]
16. Termination of mandate and substitution of arbitrator
(1)
Where the mandate of an arbitrator is terminated under section 
14
 or 
15
, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the procedure that was applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced.
(2)
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties—
(a)
where a sole arbitrator or the Chairman of the 
arbitral tribunal
 is replaced, any hearing previously held shall be held afresh; and
(b)
where an arbitrator, other than a sole arbitrator or the Chairman of the 
arbitral tribunal
 is replaced, any hearings previously held may be held afresh at the discretion of the 
arbitral tribunal
.
(3)
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the 
arbitral tribunal
 made prior to the replacement of an arbitrator under this section shall not be invalidated solely because there has been a change in the composition of the 
arbitral tribunal
.
(4)
The Authority of an arbitrator is personal and ceases on his death.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 12.]

(1)
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitrator who withdraws from his office may, if prior notice has been given to the parties, apply to the High Court—

to grant him relief from any liability thereby incurred by him; and
(b)
to make such order as the court thinks fit with respect to his entitlement (if any) to fees or expenses or the repayment of any fees or expenses already paid.
(2)
Where the High Court is satisfied that, in the circumstances, it was reasonable for the arbitrator to resign, it may grant relief on such terms as it may think fit.
(3)
The decision of the High Court shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 13.]

Subsection (1) shall extend to apply to a servant or agent of an arbitrator in respect of the discharge or purported discharge by such a servant or agent, with due authority and in good faith, of the functions of the arbitrator.
(3)
Nothing in this section affects any liability incurred by an arbitrator by reason of his resignation or withdrawal.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 13.]
17. Competence of 
arbitral tribunal
 to rule on its jurisdiction
(1)
The 
arbitral tribunal
 may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the 
arbitration agreement
, and for that purpose—
(a)
an 
arbitration
 clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and
(b)
a decision by the 
arbitral tribunal
 that the contract is null and void shall not itself invalidate the 
arbitration
 clause.
(2)
A plea that the 
arbitral tribunal
 does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence, however, a 
party
 is not precluded from raising such a plea because he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.
(3)
A plea that the 
arbitral tribunal
 is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings.
(4)
The 
arbitral tribunal
 may, in either of the cases referred to in subsection (2) or (3) admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.
(5)
The 
arbitral tribunal
 may rule on a plea referred to in subsections (2) and (3) either as a preliminary question or in an 
arbitration
 award on the merits.
(6)
Where the 
arbitral tribunal
 rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any 
party
 aggrieved by such ruling may apply to the High Court, within 30 days after having received notice of that ruling, to decide the matter.
(7)
The decision of the High Court shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal.
(8)
While an application under subsection (6) is pending before the High Court the parties may commence, continue and conclude arbitral proceedings, but no award in such proceedings shall take effect until the application is decided and such award shall be void if the application is successful.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 14.]
18. Power of 
arbitral tribunal
(1)
Unless the parties otherwise agree, an 
arbitral tribunal
 may, on the application of a 
party
—
(a)
order any 
party
 to take such interim measure of protection as the 
arbitral tribunal
 may consider necessary in respect of the subject- matter of the dispute, with or without an ancillary order requiring the provision of appropriate security in connection with such a measure; or
(b)
order any 
party
 to provide security in respect of any claim or any amount in dispute; or
(c)
order a claimant to provide security for costs.
(2)
The 
arbitral tribunal
 or a 
party
 with the approval of the 
arbitral tribunal
, may seek assistance from the High Court in the exercise of any power conferred on the 
arbitral tribunal
 under subsection (1).
(3)
If a request is made under subsection (2) the High Court shall have, for the purposes of the arbitral proceedings, the same power to make an order for the doing of anything which the 
arbitral tribunal
 is empowered to order under subsection (1) as it would have in civil proceedings before that Court, but the arbitral proceedings shall continue notwithstanding that a request has been made and is being considered by the High Court.
[Act 
No. 11 of 2009
, s. 15.]
