Provided that where an appeal has been so dismissed or any cross-appeal so heard has been allowed, the appellant may apply to the Court to restore the appeal for hearing or to re-hear the cross-appeal, if he or she can show that he or she was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing.
(2)
If the appellant appears and the respondent fails to appear, the appeal shall proceed in the absence of the respondent and any cross- appeal may be dismissed, unless the Court deems fit to adjourn the hearing and, in such instance, may order the respondent to pay court adjournment fees in accordance with the Third Schedule and costs to the other parties present:
Provided that where an appeal has been allowed or cross-appeal dismissed in the absence of the respondent, the respondent may apply to the Court to re-hear the appeal or to restore the cross-appeal for hearing, if he or she can show that he or she was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the appeal was called on for hearing.

(a)
any two or more appeals to be consolidated on such terms as it thinks just;
(b)
any two or more appeals to be heard at the same time or one immediately after the other; or

any one or more appeals to be stayed until after the determination of any other of them.
107. Arguments at hearing
At the hearing of an appeal—
(a)
no party shall, without the leave of the Court, argue that the decision of the superior court should be reversed or varied except on a ground specified in the memorandum of appeal or a notice of cross-appeal, or support the decision of the superior court on any ground not relied on by that court or specified in a notice given under rule 95 or rule 96;
(b)
a respondent shall not, without the leave of the Court, raise any objection to the competence of the appeal which might have been raised by application under rule 86;
(c)
the Court shall not allow an appeal or cross-appeal on any ground not set forth or implicit in the memorandum of appeal or notice of cross-appeal without affording the respondent or any person who, in relation to that ground, should have been made a respondent, or the appellant, as the case may be, an opportunity of being heard on that ground;
and
(d)
the arguments contained in any statement lodged under rule 100 shall receive the same consideration as if they had been advanced orally at the hearing.
108. Court-annexed mediation
(1)
At any time during a case management conference or before a matter is set down for hearing, the Registrar, in consultation with and approval of the parties, may screen and refer any appeal or application to mediation:
Provided that before conclusion of any matter, the Court may refer parties to mediation.

Part V – FEES AND COSTS
109. Fees payable
Subject to rules 113 and 114, the fees set out in the Second Schedule shall be payable in respect of the matters and services set out therein:
Provided that—
(a)
no fees shall be payable upon any appeal from a superior court in exercise of its original jurisdiction in a criminal case, or on any application in connection with any such appeal, or for the supply of the copy of the record of appeal to any party to any such appeal;
(b)
no fee shall be payable by the Government in respect of any criminal application or appeal; and
(c)
copies of any documents may be issued without fees to such persons as the President may nominate or at such reduced fees as the President may direct.
110. Time of payment of fees
(1)
The fee payable on lodging any document shall be payable at the time when the document is lodged.
(2)
The Registrar or registrar of a superior court may require the payment in advance of the fee for any other service or, where the amount of the fee cannot conveniently be ascertained when the service is requested, may require a deposit towards it and any fee so paid in advance or deposit made shall be refunded if the request for the service is cancelled before the service has been undertaken.
111. Security for costs in civil appeals
(1)
Subject to rule 114, there shall be lodged in Court on the institution of a civil appeal as security for the costs of the appeal the sum of six thousand shillings.
(2)
Where an appeal has been withdrawn under rule 96 after notice of cross-appeal has been given, the Court may, on the application of any person who is a respondent to the cross-appeal—
(a)
direct the cross-appellant to lodge in Court as a security for costs the sum of two thousand shillings or any specified sum less than two thousand shillings; or
(b)
direct that the cross-appeal be heard without security for costs being lodged.
(3)
The Court may, at any time if it thinks fit, direct that further security for costs be given and that security be given for the payment of past costs relating to the matters in question in the appeal.
(4)
Where security for costs has been lodged, the Registrar may pay out the security by consent of the parties or in conformity with the decision of the Court and having regard to the rights of the parties thereunder.
112. Court adjournment fees and costs
(1)
Where an application for adjournment is sought, the Court may, for good reason, grant the adjournment and order the party responsible for occasioning the adjournment to pay court adjournment fees or such other fees as the Court may direct.
(2)
The party seeking adjournment or at whose instance the adjournment has been granted may be ordered to pay costs to the other party as the Court may deem just.
113. Assessment or taxation of costs
(1)
When making any decision as to the payment of costs, the Court may assess the same or direct them to be taxed and any decision as to the payment of costs, not being a decision whereby the amount of the costs is assessed, shall operate as a direction that the costs be taxed.
(2)
For the purpose of execution in respect of costs, the decision of the Court directing taxation and the certificate of the taxing officer as to the result of such taxation shall together be deemed to be a decree.
114. Costs improperly incurred
If it shall appear to the Court that costs have been incurred improperly or without reasonable cause, or that by reason of any undue delay in proceeding under any judgment or order, or of any misconduct or default of the advocate, any costs properly incurred have nevertheless proved fruitless to the person incurring the same, the Court may call on the advocate by whom such costs have been so incurred to show cause why such costs should not be borne by the advocate personally, and thereupon may make such order as the justice of the case may require.
115. Improper agreements for remuneration
Any agreement whereby the remuneration of an advocate or the amount thereof is dependent upon the result of any proceedings in the Court shall be void.
116. Taxation
(1)
The Registrar shall be a taxing officer with power to tax the costs arising out of any application or appeal to the Court as between party and party.
(2)
The costs contemplated under subrule (1) shall be taxed in accordance with the Third Schedule.
(3)
The remuneration of an advocate by the advocate’s clients in respect of application or appeal shall be governed by the rules of, and scales for, proceedings in the High Court.
117. Reference on taxation
(1)
A person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Registrar in his or her capacity as taxing officer may require any matter of law or principle to be referred to a judge for the judge’s decision and the judge shall determine the matter as the justice of the case may require.
(2)
For the purpose of sub rule (1), any decision extending or refusing to extend time for the lodging of a bill of costs or any exercise by the Registrar of the over-riding discretion given the Registrar by paragraph 12 of the Third Schedule shall be deemed to involve a matter of principle.
(3)
A person who contends that a bill of costs as taxed is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate, may require the bill to be referred to a judge and the judge shall have power to make such deduction or addition as will render the bill reasonable and except as provided in this subrule, there shall be no reference on a question of quantum only.
(4)
An application for a reference may be made to the Registrar informally at the time of taxation or in writing within seven days thereafter.
(5)
A reference to a judge may be adjourned for the consideration of the Court.
(6)
Any person dissatisfied by the decision of a judge given under subrule (1) or subrule (3) may apply to the Court to vary, discharge or reverse the same and such application, may be made either informally to the judge at the time of the decision or by writing to the Registrar within seven days after the time.
(7)
The President may issue practice directions as to the manner in which appeals and references shall be made under this section and the court fees, if any, that shall be paid.
118. Waiver of fees in criminal appeals
(1)
If, in any appeal from a superior court acting in in its appellate jurisdiction in any criminal matter, a judge of the superior court is satisfied on the application of the appellant—
(a)
that the appeal raises one or more questions of law proper for determination by the Court; and
(b)
that the appellant ought not, by reason of poverty, to be required to pay the whole of the fees ordinarily payable, including the fees for preparing the record of appeal, the judge may, by order, direct that the whole or any part of such fees be waived.
(2)
An application under subrule (1) may be made informally at any time but not later than seven days after the appellant has been informed of the amount which, in the absence of an order, he or she would be required to pay as fees or to deposit in respect thereof:
Provided that a judge of a superior court may entertain any such application out of time if it appears that there was sufficient cause for the delay in making the application.
(3)
No fee shall be payable on the lodging of an application under subrule (1).
(4)
A judge of a superior court considering the means of an applicant may rely on a report made to the judge by the Registrar.
(5)
A judge of a superior court, making an order under subrule (1) may, at the same time and without formal application, order the extension of the time for giving notice of appeal or for lodging the memorandum of appeal.
(6)
An order allowing or dismissing an application under subrule (1) shall be final:
Provided that the decision by the judge of the superior court that an appeal raises or does not raise a question of law proper for determination by the Court shall be conclusive of that question only in relation to the application.
119. Refund of fees paid in criminal appeals
Where an appeal is allowed from a superior court in exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction, the Court may, for sufficient reason, order the refund to the appellant of the fees paid by him or her under these Rules or any part thereof.
120. Relief from fees and security in civil appeals
(1)
If, in any appeal from a superior court, in exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction in any civil case, the Court is satisfied on the application of an appellant that the appellant lacks the means to pay the required fees or to deposit the security for costs and that the appeal is not without reasonable possibility of success, the Court may, by order, direct that the appeal may be lodged—
(a)
without prior payment of fees of Court, or on payment of any specified amount less than the required fees; or
(b)
without security for costs being lodged, or on lodging of any specified sum less than the amount fixed by rule 109, and may order that the record of appeal be prepared by the registrar of the superior court without payment therefor or on payment of any specified sum less than the fee set out in the Second Schedule conditionally on the intended appellant undertaking to pay the fees or the balance of the fees out of any money or properly the appellant may recover in or consequence of the appeal.
(2)
The Registrar shall be entitled to be heard on any such application.
(3)
No fee shall be payable on the lodging of any such application.
(4)
The Registrar shall have power to take such action as he or she may think necessary to enforce any undertaking given in accordance with subrule (1).

7. Time and adjournment
The taxing officer shall have power to limit or extend the time for proceedings before him, and to adjourn the same from time to time and from place to place.

(1)
The fee to be allowed for instruction to make, support or oppose any application shall be such sum as the taxing officer shall consider reasonable but shall not be less than one thousand shillings.
(2)
The fees to be allowed for instructions to appeal or to oppose an appeal shall be such sum as the taxing officer shall consider reasonable, having regard to the amount involved in the appeal, its nature, importance and difficulty, the interest of the parties, the other costs to be allowed, the general conduct of the proceedings, the fund or person to bear the costs and all other relevant circumstances.

10. Fees for drawing documents
The fee for drawing a document shall include the preparation of all copies for the use of the party drawing it and for filing and service when only one other party or one advocate for other parties has to be served; where there are additional parties, fees may be charged for making the necessary additional copies.
11. Taxation of bills
(1)
On taxation the taxing officer shall allow such costs, charges and disbursements as shall appear to him to have been reasonably incurred for the attainment of justice but no costs shall be allowed which appear to the taxing officer to have been incurred through overpayment, extravagance, over caution, negligence or mistake or payment of special charges or expenses to witnesses or other persons or by other unusual expenses.
(2)
In taxing the costs of any civil appeal, the taxing officer shall disallow the costs of any matter improperly included in the record of appeal or in any supplementary record of appeal.
12. Overriding discretion
If, after a bill of costs has been taxed, the taxing officer considers that, having regard to all the circumstances, the total of the bill before signing the certificate of taxation is excessive, he may make such a deduction from the total as will in his opinion render the sum reasonable.
13. Excessive claims

14. Set-off of costs
Where a party entitled to receive costs is also liable to pay costs, the taxing officer may tax the costs which that party is liable to pay and adjust them by way of deduction or set-off and direct payment of any balance.
15. Costs of more than one advocate
(1)
Costs of more than one advocate shall not be allowed unless the Court has so directed:
Provided that if an advocate has instructed another advocate to appear at the hearing of an appeal, the fee paid to the latter, or so much thereof as the taxing officer considers reasonable, may be allowed but so that the total of such fee and the instructions fee allowed to the instructing advocate shall not be greater than it would have been if one advocate only had acted in the matter.
(2)
Where the Court has directed that the costs of two advocates be allowed—
(a)
where the senior advocate is not a member of the same firm as the advocate on the record, he shall be allowed the fee paid to him, including fees for attending in court, or so much thereof as the taxing officer shall consider reasonable;
(b)
where the senior advocate is a member of the same firm as the advocate on the record, he shall be allowed such fee as would have been allowed in the case of an advocate not a member of that firm; and
(c)
the advocate on record shall be allowed the usual instruction, hearing and other fees.
(3)
The fee paid to another advocate by the advocate on the record shall be shown as a disbursement.
16. Costs where advocate changed during proceedings
If there has been a change of advocates the bill of costs of the first advocate may be annexed to that of the current advocate and its total shown as a disbursement and the bill will be taxed in the ordinary way, the current advocate being heard on it, but the taxing officer may require the advocate to attend.
17. Two or more parties
Where the same advocate is employed for two or more parties and separate proceedings are taken by or on behalf of any two such parties, the taxing officer shall consider in the taxation of such advocate's bill of costs whether such separate proceedings were necessary and proper, and if he is of opinion that any part of the costs occasioned thereby has been unnecessarily or improperly incurred, the same shall be disallowed.
18. Costs where trustees defend
In taxing the costs as between party and party or for payment out of a trust fund of joint executors or trustees who are separately represented, the taxing officer shall, unless otherwise ordered by the Court or a Judge, allow only one set of costs for such parties, such costs to be apportioned among them as the taxing officer shall deem fit.
