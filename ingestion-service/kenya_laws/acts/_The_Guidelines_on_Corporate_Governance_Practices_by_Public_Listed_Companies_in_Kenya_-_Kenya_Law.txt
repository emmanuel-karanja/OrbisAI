1.
Introduction
1.1.
The Capital Markets Authority (the Authority) has developed these guidelines for good corporate governance practices by public listed companies in Kenya in response to the growing importance of governance issues both in emerging and developing economies and for promoting growth in domestic and regional capital markets. It is also in recognition of the role of good governance in corporate performance, capital formation and maximization of shareholders value as well as protection of investors’ rights.
1.2.
Corporate governance, for the purpose of these guidelines is defined as the process and structure used to direct and manage business affairs of the company towards enhancing prosperity and corporate accounting with the ultimate objective of realising shareholders long-term value while taking into account the interest of other stakeholders.
1.3.
These guidelines have been developed taking into account the work which has been undertaken extensively by several jurisdictions through many task forces and committees including but not limited to the United Kingdom, Malaysia, South Africa, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Commonwealth Association for Corporate Governance.
The Authority has also supported development of a code of best practice for corporate governance in Kenya issued by the Private Sector Corporate Governance Trust, Kenya, whose efforts have also been useful in the development of these guidelines and are supplementary thereto.
1.4.
The objective of these guidelines is to strengthen corporate governance practices by public listed companies in Kenya and to promote the standards of self-regulation so as to bring the level of governance in line with international trends.
1.5.
The Authority, in developing these guidelines has adopted both a prescriptive and a non-prescriptive approach in order to provide for flexibility and innovative dynamism to corporate governance practices by public listed companies.
1.6
Good corporate governance practices must be nurtured and encouraged to evolve as a matter of best practice but certain aspects of operation in a body corporate must of necessity require minimum standards of good governance. In this regard the Authority expects the directors of every public listed company to undertake or commit themselves to adopt good corporate governance practices as part of their continuing listing obligations.
1.7
It is important that the extent of compliance with these guidelines should form an essential part of disclosure obligations in the corporate annual reports. It is equally important the extent of non-compliance be also disclosed.
1.8
Every public listed company shall disclose, on an annual basis, in its annual report, a statement of the directors as to whether the company is complying with these guidelines on corporate governance with effect from the financial year ending during 2002, as prescribed under the Capital Markets (Securities) (Public Offers, Listing and Disclosure) Regulations.
1.9
All issuers of fixed income securities or debt instruments through the capital markets such as bonds and commercial paper shall also comply with these guidelines. The issuer of the fixed income securities or debt instrument shall disclose in the information memorandum the extent of compliance with these guidelines.
1.10
Where the company or Issuer is not fully compliant with these guidelines, the Issuer shall identify the reasons for non-compliance and indicate the steps being taken to become compliant.
1.11
Whilst these guidelines have been developed for public listed companies and issuers of fixed income securities and debt instruments in Kenya’s capital market, companies in the private sector are also encouraged to practice good corporate governance.
2.

As a matter of best practice, every public listed company should endeavour to achieve the following:
3.1.
Best Practices Relating to the Board of Directors

The Role and Responsibilities of the Board of Directors
The board of Directors should assume a primary responsibility of fostering the long-term business of the corporation consistent with their fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders.

the structure of the board should also comprise a number of directors, which fairly reflects the Company’s shareholding structure.

A substantial shareholder, for the purpose of these guidelines is a person who holds not less than fifteen per cent of the voting shares of a listed company and has the ability to exercise a majority voting for the election of the directors.

(vi)
The board should disclose in its annual report whether independent and non-executive directors constitute one third of the board and if it satisfies the representation of the minority shareholders.

The size of the board should not be too large to undermine an inter-active discussion during board meetings or too small such that the inclusion of a wider expertise and skills to improve the effectiveness of the board is compromised.

(iv)
the board, through the nominating committee, should on an annual basis review its required mix of skills and expertise that the executive directors as well as independent and non-executive directors bring to the Board and make disclosure of the same in the annual report.

(vi)
newly appointed directors should be provided with necessary orientation in the area of the Company’s business in order to enhance their effectiveness in the Board.
(vii)
the nominating committee should recommend to the board candidates for directorship to be filled by the shareholders as the responsibility of nominating rests on the full board, after considering the recommendations of the nominating committee.
(viii)
The process of the appointment of directors should be sensitive to gender representation, national outlook and should not be perceived to represent single or narrow community interest.
(ix)
No person shall be a director in more than five public listed companies at any one time in order to ensure effective participation in the board.
3.1.4
Remuneration of the directors
(i)
The Board of Directors of every listed company should appoint a remuneration committee or assign a mandate to a nominating committee consisting mainly of independent and non-executive directors to recommend to the board the remuneration of the executive directors and the structure of their compensation package.

(vi)
The chief executive should be responsible for implementing the Board corporate decision and there should be a clear flow of information between management and the board in order to facilitate both quantitative and qualitative evaluation and appraisal of the company’s performance.
