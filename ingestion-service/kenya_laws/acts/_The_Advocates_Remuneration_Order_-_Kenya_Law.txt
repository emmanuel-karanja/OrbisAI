2. Application of Order
This Order shall apply to the remuneration of an advocate of the High Court by his client in contentious and non-contentious matters, the taxation thereof and the taxation of costs as between party and party in contentious matters in the High Court, in subordinate courts (other than Muslim courts), in a Tribunal appointed under the Landlord and Tenant (Shops, Hotels and Catering Establishments) Act (Cap. 301) and in a Tribunal established under the Rent Restriction Act (

Where any business requires and receives exceptional dispatch, or, at the request of the client, is attended to outside normal business hours the advocate shall be entitled to receive and shall be allowed such additional remuneration as is appropriate in the circumstances.
(2)
Such additional remuneration shall, except in special circumstances, be allowable only as between advocate and client.
[L.N. 62/1979, s. 5.]
5. Special fee for exceptional importance and complexity
(1)
In business of exceptional importance or of unusual complexity an advocate shall be entitled to receive and shall be allowed as against his client a special fee in addition to the remuneration provided in this Order.

In assessing such special fee regard may be had to—
(a)
the place at or the circumstances in which the business or part thereof is transacted;
(b)
the nature and extent of the pecuniary or other interest involved;
(c)
the labour and responsibility entailed; and
(d)

An advocate may accept from his client and a client may give to his advocate security for the amount to become due to the advocate for remuneration and disbursements in business to be transacted or being transacted by him and for interest as hereinafter provided on such amount, but so that interest is not to commence until the amount due is ascertained either by agreement or taxation:
Provided that, for the purpose of this rule, the amount of such costs and disbursements shall be deemed to have been agreed as at the expiry of one calendar month from the date of delivery of the bill unless the client shall within such period have disputed the same or applied to have the same taxed.
7. Interest may be charged
An advocate may charge interest at 14 per cent per annum on his disbursements and costs, whether by scale or otherwise, from the expiration of one month from the delivery of his bill to the client, provided that such claim for interest is raised before the amount of the bill shall have been paid or tendered in full.

8. Costs payable by an executor, administrator or trustee
Where costs are payable to his advocate by an executor, administrator or trustee for or in connexion with work required to be done for him in that capacity such costs shall be so computed as to afford a complete indemnity against all expenses properly incurred in the matter and any taxation thereof shall be on the basis of advocate and own client.
9. Costs payable by infant, etc
In cases where a bill of costs is payable by an infant or lunatic or out of a fund not presently available, demand for payment thereof may be made on the parent or guardian or trustee or other person liable.

The taxing officer for the taxation of bills under this Order shall be the Registrar or a district or deputy registrar of the High Court or, in the absence of a registrar, such other qualified officer as the Chief Justice may in writing appoint; except that in respect of bills under Schedule 4 to the order the taxing officer shall be the registrar of trade marks or any deputy or assistant registrar of trade marks.
[L.N. 56/1972, s. 3, L.N. 35/2014, s. 3.]
11. Objection to decision on taxation and appeal to Court of Appeal
(1)
Should any party object to the decision of the taxing officer, he may within fourteen days after the decision give notice in writing to the taxing officer of the items of taxation to which he objects.
(2)
The taxing officer shall forthwith record and forward to the objector the reasons for his decision on those items and the objector may within fourteen days from the receipt of the reasons apply to a judge by chamber summons, which shall be served on all the parties concerned, setting out the grounds of his objection.
(3)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the judge upon any objection referred to such judge under subsection (2) may, with the leave of the judge but not otherwise, appeal to the Court of Appeal.
(4)
The High Court shall have power in its discretion by order to enlarge the time fixed by subparagraph (1) or subparagraph (2) far the taking of any step; application for such an order may be made by chamber summons upon giving to every other interested party not less than three clear days’ notice in writing or as the Court may direct, and may be so made notwithstanding that the time sought to be enlarged may have already expired.
[L.N. 8/1965, Sch.]
12. Reference by consent
With the consent of both parties, the taxing officer may refer any matter in dispute arising out of the taxation of a bill for the opinion of the High Court. The procedure for such reference shall follow that of a case stated but shall be to a judge in chambers.
13. Taxation of cost as between advocate and client on application of either party
(1)
The taxing officer may tax costs as between advocate and client without any order for the purpose upon the application of the advocate or upon the application of the client, but where a client applies for taxation of a bill which has been rendered in summarized or block form the taxing officer shall give the advocate an opportunity to submit an itemized bill of costs before proceeding with such taxation, and in such event the advocate shall not be bound by or limited to the amount of the bill rendered in summarized or block form.
(2)
Due notice of the date fixed for such taxation shall be given to both parties and both shall be entitled to attend and be heard.
(3)
The bill of costs shall be filed in a miscellaneous cause in which notice of taxation may issue, but no advocate shall be entitled to an instruction fee in respect thereof.
[L.N. 73/1983, s. 3.]
13A. Powers of taxing officer
For the purpose of any proceeding before him, the taxing officer shall have power and authority to summon and examine witnesses, to administer oaths, to direct the production of books, paper and documents and to direct and adopt all such other proceedings as may be necessary for the determination of any matter in dispute before him.
[L.N. 227/1967, s. 2.]
14. Default of advocate to attend taxation after notice
Any advocate who after the due notice without reasonable excuse fail to appear on the date and at the time fixed for taxation or on any date and time to which such taxation is adjourned, or who shall in any way delay or impede the taxation, or put any other party to any unnecessary or improper expense relative to such taxation shall, on the order of the taxing officer, forfeit the fees to which he would otherwise be entitled for drawing his bill of costs and attending the taxation, and shall in addition be personally liable to pay for any unnecessary or improper expense to which he has put any party; and the taxing officer may proceed with such taxation ex parte.
15. Taxation procedure contained in Part III to apply to bills under Part II
The provisions of Part III of this Order as to the form and procedure for filing and disposal of a bill of costs for taxation shall apply in all appropriate respects and so far as practicable to any bill of costs under Part II of this Order which may require to be taxed.
16. Discretion of taxing officer
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Order, on every taxation the taxing officer may allow all such costs, charges and expenses as authorized in this Order as shall appear to him to have been necessary or proper for the attainment of justice or for defending the rights of any party, but, save as against the party who incurred the same, no costs shall be allowed which appear to the taxing officer to have been incurred or increased through overcaution, negligence or mistake, or by payment of special charges or expenses to witnesses or other persons, or by other unusual expenses.
17. Length of folio
A folio shall for all purposes of this Order be deemed to consist of 100 words and any part of a folio shall be charged as one folio. A sum or quantity of one denomination stated in figures is to be counted as one word: eg. "£25,564 16s 8d." is to be counted as three words, and "254 feet 11 inches" is to be counted as four words.
