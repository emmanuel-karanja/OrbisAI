1. As part of the measures the Registration Committee has put in place to monitor compliance with professional standards and fulfill the requirements of Statement of Membership Obligation, the Registration Committee shall roll out this self- review monitoring tool to ALL practitioners with effect from ......................
2. This tool is geared towards enabling individual firms carry out a self-review based on the level of compliance with applicable standards. It gives a firm an opportunity to gauge the major areas of non-compliance and subsequently based on need, call upon the Institute to enhance the firm’s level of compliance.
3. Firms will be selected for reviews primarily based on their risk profiles identified from a desktop review of the information submitted in this tool. This process will analyse the units’ responses in the tool and other relevant information.
4. All firms shall complete the self-review monitoring tool every two years or when called upon to do so by the Institute. However, should a firm’s processes and any information submitted earlier significantly change before the two-year period, the firm should communicate such changes to the Institute;
5. This tool will collect the following information about a firm—
(a)
organisation and management of the firm;
(b)
quality control policies and procedures established by the firm;
(c)
engagement review; and
(d)
client profile of the firm.
6. The tool mostly contains questions of a “Yes/No” answer, but some questions such as those on the organization and management of the firm, and client profile information require quantitative data. Some questions also require narrative answers. In general, a “N/A” answer should not be selected unless in the circumstances specified in this questionnaire.
7. The tool provides the following benefits—
(a)
enables a firm to pro-actively manage its own operations;
(b)
gives a firm an opportunity to point out its own weaknesses and hence enhance its own capacity to address the weaknesses;
(c)
gives an insight to the firm’s staffing needs as well as the need to address the gaps identified through training;
(d)
provides a justification to the Institute on why a firm needs considerable support or no support hence the Institute can utilize its technical team to enhance compliance in a more deserving practice unit;
(e)
prepares the firm for the Institute’s programme review;
(f)
serves as a pointer for setting performance targets to member or staff of a firm in practice;
(g)
guides the Institute in developing the annual training calendar; and
(h)
gives the Institute an overview of the governance structure of the firms.
Note:
1. Practitioners are advised to fill the tool with total honesty for it to achieve the intended objectives.
