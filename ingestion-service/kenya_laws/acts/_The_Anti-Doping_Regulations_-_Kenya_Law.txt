Ineligibility
; or

If not subject to the authority of an 
Anti-Doping Organization
, and where 
Ineligibility
 has not been addressed in a 
Results Management
 process pursuant to the 
Code
, has been convicted or found in a criminal, disciplinary or professional proceeding to have engaged in conduct which would have constituted a violation of Anti-Doping rules if 
Code
-compliant rules had been applicable to such 
Person
. The disqualifying status of such 
Person
 shall be in force for the longer of six (6) years from the criminal, professional or disciplinary decision or the duration of the criminal disciplinary or professional sanction imposed; or

Article 3 – 
PROOF OF DOPING
3.1 Burdens and Standards of Proof.
ADAK shall have the burden of establishing that an Anti-Doping rule violation has occurred. The standard of proof shall be whether ADAK has established an Anti-Doping rule violation to the comfortable satisfaction of the hearing panel, bearing in mind the seriousness of the allegation which is made. This standard of proof in all cases is greater than a mere balance of probability but less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Where these Anti-Doping Rules place the burden of proof upon the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 alleged to have committed an Anti-Doping rule violation to rebut a presumption or establish specified facts or circumstances, except as provided in Articles 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, the standard of proof shall be by a balance of probability.
3.2 Methods of Establishing Facts and Presumptions.
Facts related to Anti-Doping rule violations may be established by any reliable means, including admissions. The following rules of proof shall be applicable in doping cases:
3.2.1
Analytical methods or 
Decision Limits
 approved by 
WADA
 after consultation within the relevant scientific community or which have been the subject of peer review are presumed to be scientifically valid. Any 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 seeking to challenge whether the conditions for such presumption have been met or to rebut this presumption of scientific validity, shall as a condition precedent to any such challenge, first notify 
WADA
 of the challenge and the basis of the challenge. The initial hearing body, appellate body or 
CAS
, on its own initiative, may also inform 
WADA
 of any such challenge. Within ten (10) days of 
WADA's
 receipt of such notice and the case file related to such challenge, 
WADA
 shall also have the right to intervene as a party, appear as 
amicus curiae
 or otherwise provide evidence in such proceeding. In cases before 
CAS
, at 
WADA's
 request, the 
CAS
 panel shall appoint an appropriate scientific expert to assist the panel in its evaluation of the challenge.
3.2.2
WADA
-accredited laboratories, and other laboratories approved by 
WADA
, are presumed to have conducted 
Sample
 analysis and custodial procedures in accordance with the 
International Standard
 for Laboratories. The 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 may rebut this presumption by establishing that a departure from the 
International Standard
 for Laboratories occurred which could reasonably have caused the 
Adverse Analytical Finding
.
If the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 rebuts the preceding presumption by showing that a departure from the 
International Standard
 for Laboratories occurred which could reasonably have caused the 
Adverse Analytical Finding
, then ADAK shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the 
Adverse Analytical Finding
.
3.2.3
Departures from any other 
International Standard
 or other Anti-Doping rule or policy set forth in the 
Code
 or these Anti-Doping Rules shall not invalidate analytical results or other evidence of an Anti-Doping rule violation, and shall not constitute a defense to an Anti-Doping rule violation; provided, however, if the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 establishes that a departure from one of the specific 
International Standard
 provisions listed below could reasonably have caused an Anti-Doping rule violation based on an 
Adverse Analytical Finding
 or whereabouts failure, then ADAK shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the 
Adverse Analytical Finding
 or the whereabouts failure:
(i)
a departure from the 
International Standard
 for 
Testing
 and Investigations related to 
Sample
 collection or 
Sample
 handling which could reasonably have caused an Anti-Doping rule violation based on an 
Adverse Analytical Finding
, in which case ADAK shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the 
Adverse Analytical Finding
;
(ii)
a departure from the 
International Standard
 for 
Results Management
 or 
International Standard
 for 
Testing
 and Investigations related to an 
Adverse Passport Finding
 which could reasonably have caused an Anti-Doping rule violation in which case ADAK shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the Anti-Doping rule violation;
(iii)
a departure from the 
International Standard
 for 
Results Management
 related to the requirement to provide notice to the 
Athlete
 of the B 
Sample
 opening which could reasonably have caused an Anti-Doping rule violation based on an 
Adverse Analytical Finding
, in which case ADAK shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the 
Adverse Analytical Finding
;
(iv)
a departure from the 
International Standard
 for 
Results Management
 related to 
Athlete
 notification which could reasonably have caused an Anti-Doping rule violation based on a whereabouts failure, in which case ADAK shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the whereabouts failure.
3.2.4
The facts established by a decision of a court or professional disciplinary tribunal of competent jurisdiction which is not the subject of a pending appeal shall be irrebuttable evidence against the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 to whom the decision pertained of those facts unless the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 establishes that the decision violated principles of natural justice.
3.2.5
The hearing panel in a hearing on an Anti-Doping rule violation may draw an inference adverse to the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 who is asserted to have committed an Anti-Doping rule violation based on the 
Athlete’s
 or other 
Person’s
 refusal, after a request made in a reasonable time in advance of the hearing, to appear at the hearing (either in person or telephonically as directed by the hearing panel) and to answer questions from the hearing panel or ADAK.

The TUEC shall promptly evaluate and decide upon the application in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
International Standard
 for 
Therapeutic Use Exemptions
 and usually (i.e., unless exceptional circumstances apply) within no more than twenty-one (21) days of receipt of a complete application. Where the application is made in a reasonable time prior to an 
Event
, the TUEC must use its best endeavors to issue its decision before the start of the 
Event
.
4.4.2.4
The TUEC decision shall be the final decision of ADAK and may be appealed in accordance with Article 4.4. 6. ADAKTUEC decision shall be notified in writing to the 
Athlete
, and to 
WADA
 and other 
Anti-Doping Organizations
 in accordance with the 
International Standard
 for 
Therapeutic Use Exemptions
. It shall also promptly be reported into 
ADAMS
.
4.4.3
Retroactive 
TUE
 Applications
If ADAK chooses to test an 
Athlete
 who is not an 
International-Level
 or a 
National-Level Athlete
, ADAK must permit that 
Athlete
 to apply for a retroactive 
TUE
 for any 
Prohibited Substance
 or 
Prohibited Method
 that he or she is 
Using
 for therapeutic reasons.
4.4.4
TUE
 Recognition
A 
TUE
 granted by ADAK is valid at any national level in any country and does not need to be formally recognized by any other 
National Anti-Doping Organization
.
However, it is not automatically valid if the 
Athlete
 becomes an 
International-Level Athlete
 or competes in an 
International Event
, unless it is recognized by the relevant International Federation or 
Major Event Organization
 in accordance with the 
International Standard
 for 
Therapeutic Use Exemptions
 as follows:
4.4.4.1
Where the 
Athlete
 already has a 
TUE
 granted by ADAK for the substance or method in question, unless their 
TUE
 will be automatically recognized by the International Federation or 
Major Event Organization
, the 
Athlete
 shall apply to their International Federation or to the 
Major Event Organization
 to recognize that 
TUE
. If that 
TUE
 meets the criteria set out in the 
International Standard
 for 
Therapeutic Use Exemptions
, then the International Federation or 
Major Event Organization
 must recognize it.
If the International Federation or 
Major Event Organization
 considers that the 
TUE
 granted by ADAK does not meet those criteria and so refuses to recognize it, the International Federation shall promptly notify the 
Athlete
 and ADAK with reasons. The 
Athlete
 and/or ADAK shall have twenty one (21) days from such notification to refer the matter to 
WADA
 for review in accordance with Article 4.4.6.
If the matter is referred to 
WADA
 for review in accordance with Article 4.4.6, the 
TUE
 granted by ADAK remains valid for national level 
Competition
 and 
Out-of-Competition Testing
 (but is not valid for international-level 
Competition
) pending 
WADA's
 decision.
If the matter is not referred to 
WADA
 for review within the twenty-one (21) day deadline, ADAK must determine whether the original 
TUE
 that it granted should nevertheless remain valid for national-level 
Competition
  and 
Out-of-Competition Testing
 (provided that the 
Athlete
 ceases to be an 
International-Level Athlete
 and does not participate in International-level 
Competition
). Pending ADAK's decision, the 
TUE
 remains valid for national-level 
Competition
 and 
Out-of-Competition Testing
 (but is not valid for international-level 
Competition
).
4.4.4.2
If the 
Athlete
 does not already have a 
TUE
 granted by ADAK for the substance or method in question, the 
Athlete
 must apply directly to the International Federation for a 
TUE
 in accordance with the process set out in the 
International Standard
 for 
Therapeutic Use Exemptions
 as soon as the need arises.
If the International Federation denies the 
Athlete’s
 application, it shall notify the 
Athlete
 promptly, with reasons.
If the International Federation grants the 
Athlete’s
 application, it shall notify the 
Athlete
 and ADAK. If ADAK considers that the 
TUE
 granted by the International Federation does not meet the criteria set out in the 
International Standard
 for 
Therapeutic Use Exemptions
, it has twenty-one (21) days from such notification to refer the matter to 
WADA
 for review.
If ADAK refers the matter to 
WADA
 for review, the 
TUE
 granted by the International Federation remains valid for international-Ievel 
Competition
 and 
Out-of-Competition Testing
 (but is not valid for national level 
Competition
) pending 
WADA's
 decision.
If ADAK does not refer the matter to 
WADA
 for review, the 
TUE
 granted by the International Federation becomes valid for national-level 
Competition
 as well when the twenty-one (21) day review deadline expires.

(b)
will be withdrawn if the 
Athlete
 does not promptly comply with any requirements or conditions imposed by the TUEC upon grant of the TUE;
(c)
may be withdrawn by the TUEC if it is subsequently determined that the criteria for grant of a 
TUE
 are not in fact met; or

Consequences
 based on their 
Use
 or 
Possession
 or 
Administration
 of the 
Prohibited Substance
 or 
Prohibited Method
 in question in accordance with the 
TUE
 prior to the effective date of expiry, withdrawal, or reversal of the TUE. The review pursuant to Article 5.1.1.1 of the 
International Standard
 for 
Results Management
 of an 
Adverse Analytical Finding
, reported shortly after the 
TUE
 expiry, withdrawal, or reversal, shall include consideration of whether such finding is consistent with 
Use
 of the 
Prohibited Substance
 or 
Prohibited Method
 prior to that date, in which event no Anti-Doping rule violation shall be asserted.
4.4.6
Reviews and Appeals of 
TUE
 Decisions

 will not interfere with it. If the 
TUE
 decision does not meet those criteria 
WADA
 will reverse it.
4.4.6.3
Any 
TUE
 decision by an International Federation (or by ADAK where it has agreed to consider the application on behalf of an International Federation) that is not reviewed by

7.4.1
Mandatory 
Provisional Suspension
 after an 
Adverse Analytical Finding
 or 
Adverse Passport Finding
If ADAK receives an Adverse Analytical Finding or an Adverse Passport Finding (upon completion of the Adverse Passport Finding review process) for a 
Prohibited Substance
 or a 
Prohibited Method
 that is not a 
Specified Substance
 or a 
Specified Method
, it shall impose a 
Provisional Suspension
 on the 
Athlete
 promptly upon or after the review and notification required by Article 7.2.
A mandatory 
Provisional Suspension
 may be eliminated if:
(i)
the 
Athlete
 demonstrates to the ADAK’s Hearing Panel that the violation is likely to have involved a 
Contaminated Product
, or
(ii)
the violation involves a 
Substance of Abuse
 and the 
Athlete
 establishes entitlement to a reduced period of 
Ineligibility
 under Article 10.2.4.1.
The ADAK’s Hearing Panel's decision not to eliminate a mandatory 
Provisional Suspension
 on account of the 
Athlete's
 assertion regarding a 
Contaminated Product
 shall not be appealable.
7.4.2
Optional 
Provisional Suspension
 Based on an 
Adverse Analytical Finding
 for 
Specified Substances, Specified Methods, Contaminated Products
, or Other Anti-Doping Rule Violations.
ADAK may impose a 
Provisional Suspension

Athlete’s
 B 
Sample
 or final hearing as described in Article 8.
An optional 
Provisional Suspension
 may be lifted at the discretion of ADAK at any time prior to the ADAK's Hearing Panel's decision under Article 8, unless provided otherwise in the 
International Standard
 for 
Results Management
.
7.4.3
Opportunity for Hearing or Appeal
Notwithstanding Articles 7.4.1 and 7.4.2, a
 Provisional Suspension
 may not be imposed unless the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 is given:
(a)
an opportunity for a 
Provisional Hearing
, either before or on a timely basis after imposition of the 
Provisional Suspension
; or
(b)
an opportunity for an expedited hearing in accordance with Article 8 on a timely basis after imposition of the

The imposition of a 
Provisional Suspension
, or the decision not to impose a 
Provisional Suspension
, may be appealed in an expedited process in accordance with Article 13.2.
7.4.4
Voluntary Acceptance of 
Provisional Suspension
Athletes
 on their own initiative may voluntarily accept a 
Provisional Suspension
 if done so prior to the later of:
(i)
the expiration of ten (10) days from the report of the B 
Sample
 (or waiver of the B 
Sample
) or ten (10) days from the notice of any other Anti-Doping rule violation; or
(ii)
the date on which the 
Athlete
 first competes after such report or notice.
Other 
Persons
 on their own initiative may voluntarily accept a 
Provisional Suspension
 if done so within ten (10) days from the notice of the Anti-Doping rule violation.
Upon such voluntary acceptance, the 
Provisional Suspension
 shall have the full effect and be treated in the same manner as if the 
Provisional Suspension
 had been imposed under Article 7.4.1 or 7.4.2; provided, however, at any time after voluntarily accepting a 
Provisional Suspension
, the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 may withdraw such acceptance, in which event the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 shall not receive any credit for time previously served during the 
Provisional Suspension
.
7.4.5
If a 
Provisional Suspension
 is imposed based on an A 
Sample
 
Adverse Analytical Finding
 and a subsequent B 
Sample
 analysis (if requested by the 
Athlete
 or ADAK) does not confirm the A 
Sample
 analysis, then the 
Athlete
 shall not be subject to any further 
Provisional Suspension
 on account of a violation of Article 2.1. In circumstances where the 
Athlete
 (or the 
Athlete’s
 team) has been removed from an 
Event
 based on a violation of Article 2.1 and the subsequent B 
Sample
 analysis does not confirm the A 
Sample
 finding, then, if it is still possible for the 
Athlete
 or team to be reinserted without otherwise affecting the 
Event
, the 
Athlete
 or team may continue to take part in the 
Event
.
7.5 
Results Management
 Decisions.
Results Management
 decisions or adjudications by ADAK must not purport to be limited to a particular geographic area or sport and shall address and determine without limitation the following issues:

whether an Anti-Doping rule violation was committed or a 
Provisional Suspension
 should be imposed, the factual basis for such determination, and the specific Articles that have been violated, and
(ii)
all 
Consequences
 flowing from the Anti-Doping rule violation(s), including applicable 
Disqualifications
 under Articles 9 and 10.10, any forfeiture of medals or prizes, any period of

International Standard
 for

.
7.7 Retirement from Sport
If an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 retires while the ADAK's 
Results Management
 process is underway, ADAK retains authority to complete its 
Results Management
 process. If an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 retires before any 
Results Management
 process has begun, and ADAK would have had 
Results Management
 authority over the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 at the time the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 committed an Anti-Doping rule violation, ADAK has authority to conduct 
Results Management
.

Event
, lead to 
Disqualification
 of all of the 
Athlete’s

 or 
Negligence
 for the violation, the

If the ingestion, 
Use
 or 
Possession
 occurred 
In-Competition
, and the 
Athlete

Use
 or 
Possession
 was unrelated to sport performance, then the ingestion, 
Use

Ineligibility
 otherwise applicable shall be increased by an additional period of 
Ineligibility

ADAK may, prior to an appellate decision under Article 13 or the expiration of the time to appeal, suspend a part of the 
Consequences
 (other than 
Disqualification
 and mandatory 
Public Disclosure
) imposed in an individual case where the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 has provided 
Substantial Assistance
 to an 
Anti-Doping Organization
, criminal authority or professional disciplinary body which results in:
(i)
the 
Anti-Doping Organization
 discovering or bringing forward an Anti-Doping rule violation 
by another Person; or
(ii)
which results in a criminal or disciplinary body discovering or bringing forward a criminal offense or the breach of professional rules committed by another 
Person
 and the information provided by the 
Person
 providing 
Substantial Assistance
 is made available to ADAK or other 
Anti-Doping Organization
 with 
Results Management
 responsibility; or
(iii)
which results in 
WADA
 initiating a proceeding against a 
Signatory
, 
WADA
-accredited laboratory or 
Athlete
 passport management unit (as defined in the 
International Standard
 for 
Testing
 and Investigations) for non-compliance with the 
Code International Standard
 or 
Technical Document
; or
(iv)
with the approval by 
WADA
, which results in a criminal or disciplinary body bringing forward a criminal offense or the breach of professional or sport rules arising out of a sport integrity violation other than doping. After an appellate decision under Article 13 or the expiration of time to appeal, ADAK may only suspend a part of the otherwise applicable 
Consequences
 with the approval of 
WADA
 and the applicable International Federation.
The extent to which the otherwise applicable period of 
Ineligibility
 may be suspended shall be based on the seriousness of the Anti-Doping rule violation committed by the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 and the significance of the 
Substantial Assistance
 provided by the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 to the effort to eliminate doping in sport, non-compliance with the 
Code
 and/or sport integrity violations.
No more than three-quarters of the otherwise applicable period of 
Ineligibility

Athlete
 or other 
Person
 who seeks to provide 
Substantial Assistance
, ADAK shall allow the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 to provide the information to it subject to a 
Without Prejudice Agreement
.
If the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 fails to continue to cooperate and to provide the complete and credible 
Substantial Assistance
 upon which a suspension of 
Consequences
 was based, ADAK shall reinstate the original 
Consequences
. If ADAK decides to reinstate suspended 
Consequences
 or decides not to reinstate suspended 
Consequences
, that decision may be appealed by any 
Person
 entitled to appeal under Article 13.

Athletes
 and other 
Persons
 to provide 
Substantial Assistance

Athlete
 or other 
Person
 who has, or has been asserted to have, committed an Anti-Doping rule violation, or other violation of the 
Code
, 
WADA
 may agree at any stage of the 
Results Management
 process, including after an appellate decision under Article 13, to what it considers to be an appropriate suspension of the otherwise-applicable period of 
Ineligibility
 and other 
Consequences
. In exceptional circumstances, 
WADA
 may agree to suspensions of the period of 
Ineligibility
 and other 
Consequences
 for 
Substantial Assistance
 greater than those otherwise provided in this Article, or even no period of 
Ineligibility
, no mandatory 
Public Disclosure
 and/or no return of prize money or payment of fines or costs. 
WADA
' s approval shall be subject to reinstatement of 
Consequences

Substantial Assistance
, then notice providing justification for the decision shall be provided to the other 
Anti-Doping Organizations
 with a right to appeal under Article 13.2.3 as provided in Article 14.2. In unique circumstances where

10.7.2
Admission of an Anti-Doping Rule Violation in the Absence of other Evidence
Where an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 voluntarily admits the commission of an Anti-Doping rule violation before having received notice of a 
Sample
 collection which could establish an Anti-Doping rule violation (or, in the case of an Anti-Doping rule violation other than Article 2.1, before receiving first notice of the admitted violation pursuant to Article 7) and that admission is the only reliable evidence of the violation at the time of admission, then the period of 
Ineligibility
 may be reduced, but not below one-half of the period of 
Ineligibility
 otherwise applicable.
10.7.3
Application of Multiple Grounds for Reduction of a Sanction.
Where an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 establishes entitlement to reduction in sanction under more than one provision of Article 10.5, 10.6 or 10.7, before applying any reduction or suspension under Article 10.7, the otherwise applicable period of 
Ineligibility
 shall be determined in accordance with Articles 10.2, 10.3, 10.5 and 10.6. If the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 establishes entitlement to a reduction or suspension of the period of 
Ineligibility
 under Article 10.7, then the period of 
Ineligibility
 may be reduced or suspended, but not below one-fourth of the otherwise applicable period of 
Ineligibility
.
10.8 
Results Management
 Agreements.
10.8.1
One (1) Year Reduction for Certain Anti-Doping Rule Violations Based on Early Admission and Acceptance of Sanction.
Where an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
, after being notified by ADAK of a potential Anti-Doping rule violation that carries an asserted period of 
Ineligibility
 of four (4) or more years (including any period of 
Ineligibility
 asserted under Article 10.4), admits the violation and accepts the asserted period of 
Ineligibility
 no later than twenty (20) days after receiving notice of an Anti-Doping rule violation charge, the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 may receive a one (1) year reduction in the period of 
Ineligibility
 asserted by ADAK. Where the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 receives the one (1) year reduction in the asserted period of 
Ineligibility
 under this Article 10.8.1, no further reduction in the asserted period of 
Ineligibility
 shall be allowed under any other Article.
10.8.2
Case Resolution Agreement.
Where the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 admits an Anti-Doping rule violation after being confronted with the Anti-Doping rule violation by ADAK and agrees to 
Consequences
 acceptable to ADAK and 
WADA
, at their sole discretion, then:
(a)
the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 may receive a reduction in the period of 
Ineligibility
 based on an assessment by ADAK and 
WADA
 of the application of Articles 10.1 through 10.7 to the asserted Anti-Doping rule violation, the seriousness of the violation, the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person’s
 degree of 
Fault
 and how promptly the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 admitted the violation; and
(b)
the period of 
Ineligibility
 may start as early as the date of 
Sample
 collection or the date on which another Anti-Doping rule violation last occurred. In each case, however, where this Article is applied, the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 shall serve at least one-half of the agreed-upon period of 
Ineligibility
 going forward from the earlier of the date the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 accepted the imposition of a sanction or a 
Provisional Suspension
 which was subsequently respected by the 
Athlete
 or other Person. The decision by 
WADA
 and ADAK to enter or not enter into a case resolution agreement, and the amount of the reduction to, and the starting date of the period of 
Ineligibility
, are not matters for determination or review by a hearing body and are not subject to appeal under Article 13.
If so requested by an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 who seeks to enter into a case resolution agreement under this Article, ADAK shall allow the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 to discuss an admission of the Anti Doping rule violation with it subject to a 
Without Prejudice Agreement
.
10.9 Multiple Violations.
10.9.1
Second or Third Anti-Doping Rule Violation.
10.9.1.1
For an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person’s
 second Anti-Doping rule violation the period of 
Ineligibility
 shall be the greater of:
(a)
a six (6) month period of 
Ineligibility
; or
(b)
a period of 
Ineligibility
 in the range between:
(i)
the sum of the period of 
Ineligibility
 imposed for the first Anti-Doping rule violation plus the period of 
Ineligibility
 otherwise applicable to the second Anti Doping rule violation treated as if it were a first violation; and
(ii)
twice the period of 
Ineligibility
 otherwise applicable to the second Anti-Doping rule violation treated as if it were a first violation.
The period of 
Ineligibility
 within this range shall be determined based on the entirety of the circumstances and the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person’s
 degree of 
Fault
 with respect to the second violation.
10.9.1.2
A third Anti-Doping rule violation will always result in a lifetime period of 
Ineligibility
 except if the third violation fulfills the condition for elimination or reduction of the period of 
Ineligibility
 under Article 10.5 or 10.6 or involves a violation of Article 2.4. In these particular cases the period of 
Ineligibility
 shall be from eight (8) years to lifetime 
Ineligibility
.
10.9.1.3
The period of 
Ineligibility
 established in Articles 10.9.1.1 and 10.9.1.2 may then be further reduced by the application of Article 10.7.
10.9.2
An Anti-Doping rule violation for which an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 has established 
No Fault
 or 
Negligence
 shall not be considered a violation for purposes of this Article 10.9. In addition an Anti-Doping rule violation sanctioned under Article 10.2.4.1 shall not be considered a violation for purposes of Article 10.9.
10.9.3
Additional Rules for Certain Potential Multiple Violations.
10.9.3.1
For purposes of imposing sanctions under Article 10.9, except as provided in Articles 10.9.3.2 and 10.9.3.3, an Anti-Doping rule violation will only be considered a second violation if ADAK can establish that the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 committed the additional Anti-Doping rule violation after the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 received notice pursuant to Article 7, or after ADAK made reasonable efforts to give notice of the first Anti-Doping rule violation. If ADAK cannot establish this, the violations shall be considered together as one single first violation, and the sanction imposed shall be based on the violation that carries the more severe sanction, including the application of 
Aggravating Circumstances
. Results in all 
Competitions
 dating back to the earlier Anti-Doping rule violation will be 
Disqualified
 as provided in Article 10.10.
10.9.3.2
If ADAK establishes that an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 committed an additional Anti-Doping rule violation prior to notification, and that the additional violation occurred twelve (12) months or more before or after the first-noticed violation, then the period of 
Ineligibility
 for the additional violation shall be calculated as if the additional violation were a stand-alone first violation and this period of 
Ineligibility
 is served consecutively, rather than concurrently, with the period of 
Ineligibility
 imposed for the earlier-noticed violation. Where this Article 10.9.3.2 applies, the violations taken together shall constitute a single violation for purposes of Article 10.9.1.
10.9.3.3
If ADAK establishes that an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 committed a violation of Article 2.5 in connection with the 
Doping Control
 process for an underlying asserted Anti-Doping rule violation, the violation of Article 2.5 shall be treated as a stand-alone first violation and the period of 
Ineligibility
 for such violation shall be served consecutively, rather than concurrently, with the period of 
Ineligibility
, if any, imposed for the underlying Anti-Doping rule violation. Where this Article 10.9.3.3 is applied, the violations taken together shall constitute a single violation for purposes of Article 10.9.1.
10.9.3.4
If ADAK establishes that an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 has committed a second or third Anti-Doping rule violation during a period of 
Ineligibility
 the periods of 
Ineligibility
 for the multiple violations shall run consecutively rather than concurrently.
10.9.4
Multiple Anti-Doping Rule Violations during Ten (10) Year Period.
For purposes of Article 10.9, each Anti-Doping rule violation must take place within the same ten (10) year period in order to be considered multiple violations.
10.10

In Competitions
 Subsequent to 
Sample
 Collection or Commission of an Anti Doping Rule Violation.
In addition to the automatic 
Disqualification
 of the results in the

Sample
 under Article 9, all other competitive results of the 
Athlete
 obtained from the date a positive 
Sample
 was collected (whether 
In-Competition
 or 
Out-of-Competition
), or other Anti-Doping rule violation occurred, through the commencement of any 
Provisional Suspension
 or 
Ineligibility
 period, shall, unless fairness requires otherwise, be 
Disqualified
 with all of the resulting 
Consequences
 including forfeiture of any medals, points and prizes.
10.11 Forfeited Prize Money.
If ADAK recovers prize money forfeited as a result of an Anti-Doping rule violation, it shall take reasonable measures to allocate and distribute this prize money to the 
Athletes
 who would have been entitled to it had the forfeiting 
Athlete
 not competed.
10.12 
Financial Consequences
10.12.1
Where an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 commits an Anti-Doping rule violation, ADAK may, in its discretion and subject to the principle of proportionality, elect to—
(a)
recover from the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 costs associated with the Anti-Doping rule violation, regardless of the period of 
Ineligibility
 imposed and/or.
(b)
fine the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 in an amount up to Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) Kenya Shillings only in cases where the maximum period of 
Ineligibility
 otherwise applicable has already been imposed.
10.12.2
The imposition of a financial sanction or the ADAK's recovery of costs shall not be considered a basis for reducing the 
Ineligibility
 or other sanction which would otherwise be applicable under these Anti-Doping Rules.
10.13 Commencement of 
Ineligibility
 Period.
Where an 
Athlete
 is already serving a period of 
Ineligibility
 for an Anti-Doping rule violation, any new period of 
Ineligibility
 shall commence on the first day after the current period of 
Ineligibility
 has been served. Otherwise, except is provided below, the period of 
Ineligibility
 shall start on the date of the final hearing decision providing for 
Ineligibility
 or, if the hearing is waived or there is no hearing, on the date 
Ineligibility
 is accepted or otherwise imposed.
10.13.1
Delays Not Attributable to the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
.
Where there have been substantial delays in the hearing process or other aspects of 
Doping Control
, and the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 can establish that such delays are not attributable to the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
, ADAK or ADAK's Hearing Panel, if applicable, may start the period of 
Ineligibility
 at an earlier date commencing as early as the date of 
Sample
 collection or the date on which another Anti-Doping rule violation last occurred. All competitive results achieved during the period of 
Ineligibility
, including retroactive 
Ineligibility
, shall be 
Disqualified
.

Credit for 
Provisional Suspension
 or Period of 
Ineligibility

Provisional Suspension
 is respected by the

Athlete
 or other 
Person
 shall receive a credit for such period of 
Provisional Suspension
 against any period of 
Ineligibility
 which may ultimately be imposed. If the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 does not respect a 
Provisional Suspension
, then the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 shall receive no credit for any period of 
Provisional Suspension
 served. If a period of 
Ineligibility
 is served pursuant to a decision that is subsequently appealed, then the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 shall receive a credit for such period of 
Ineligibility
 served against any period of 
Ineligibility
 which may ultimately be imposed on appeal.
10.13.2.2
If an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 voluntarily accepts a 
Provisional Suspension
 in writing from ADAK and thereafter respects the 
Provisional Suspension
, the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 shall receive a credit for such period of voluntary 
Provisional Suspension
 against any period of 
Ineligibility
 which may ultimately be imposed. A copy of the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person’s
 voluntary acceptance of a 
Provisional Suspension
 shall be provided promptly to each party entitled to receive notice of an asserted Anti-Doping rule violation under Article 14.1.
10.13.2.3
No credit against a period of 
Ineligibility
 shall be given for any time period before the effective date of the 
Provisional Suspension
 or voluntary 
Provisional Suspension
 regardless of whether the 
Athlete
 elected not to compete or was suspended by a team.
10.13.2.4
In 
Team Sports
, where a period of 
Ineligibility
 is imposed upon a team, unless fairness requires otherwise, the period of 
Ineligibility
 shall start on the date of the final hearing decision providing for 
Ineligibility
 or, if the hearing is waived, on the date 
Ineligibility
 is accepted or otherwise imposed. Any period of team 
Provisional Suspension
 (whether imposed or voluntarily accepted) shall be credited against the total period of 
Ineligibility
 to be served.

23.2
The comments annotating various provisions of the 
Code
 shall be used to interpret the 
Code
.
23.3
The 
Code
 shall be interpreted as an independent and autonomous text and not by reference to the existing law or statutes of the 
Signatories
 or governments.
23.4
The headings used for the various Parts and Articles of the 
Code
 are for convenience only and shall not be deemed part of the substance of the 
Code
 or to affect in any way the language of the provisions to which they refer.
23.5
Where the term "days" is used in the 
Code
 or an 
International Standard
, it shall mean calendar days unless otherwise specified.
23.6
The 
Code
 shall not apply retroactively to matters pending before the date the 
Code
 is accepted by a 
Signatory
 and implemented in Its rules. However, pre-
Code
 Anti-Doping rule violations would continue to count as "First violations" or "Second violations" for purposes of determining sanctions under Article 10 for subsequent post-
Code
 violations.
23.7
The Purpose, Scope and Organization of the World Anti-Doping Program and the 
Code
 and Appendix 1, Definitions, shall be considered integral parts of the 
Code
.
Article 24 – FINAL PROVISIONS
24.1
Where the term "days" is used in these Anti Doping Rules, it shall mean calendar days unless otherwise specified.
24.2
These Anti-Doping Rules shall be interpreted as an independent and autonomous text and not by reference to existing law or statutes.
24.3
These Anti-Doping Rules have been adopted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the 
Code
 and the 
International Standards
 and shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with applicable provisions of the 
Code
 and the 
International Standards
. The 
Code
 and the 
International Standards
 shall be considered integral parts of these Anti-Doping Rules and shall prevail in case of conflict.
24.4
The Introduction and Appendix 1 shall be considered integral parts of these Anti-Doping Rules.
24.5
The comments annotating various provisions of the 
Code
 are incorporated by reference into these Anti-Doping Rules, shall be treated as if set out fully herein, and shall be used to interpret these Anti-Doping Rules.
24.6
These Anti-Doping Rules shall enter into force on 1 January 2021 (the "Effective Date"). They repeal ADAK's Anti-Doping Rules, 2016.
24.7
These Anti-Doping Rules shall not apply retroactively to matters pending before the Effective Date. However:
24.7.1 Anti-Doping rule violations taking place prior to the Effective Date count as "first violations" or "second violations" for purposes of determining sanctions under Article 10 for violations taking place after the Effective Date.
24.7.2 Any Anti-Doping rule violation case which is pending as of the Effective Date and any Anti-Doping rule violation case brought after the Effective Date based on an Anti-Doping rule violation which occurred prior to the Effective Date, shall be governed by the substantive Anti-Doping rules in effect at the time the alleged Anti-Doping rule violation occurred, and not by the substantive Anti-Doping rules set out in these Anti-Doping Rules, unless the panel hearing the case determines the principle of lex mitior appropriately applies under the circumstances of the case. For these purposes, the retrospective periods in which prior violations can be considered for purposes of multiple violations under Article 10.9.4 and the statute of limitations set forth in Article 16 are procedural rules, not substantive rules, and should be applied retroactively along with all of the other procedural rules in these Anti-Doping Rules (provided, however, that Article 16 shall only be applied retroactively if the statute of limitation period has not already expired by the Effective Date).
24.7.3 Any Article 2.4 whereabouts failure (whether a filing failure or a missed test as those terms are defined in the 
International Standard
 for 
Results Management
) prior to the Effective Date shall be carried forward and may be relied upon, prior to expiry, in accordance with the 
International Standard
 for 
Results Management
 but it shall be deemed to have expired twelve (12) months after it occurred.
24.7.4 With respect to cases where a final decision finding an Anti-Doping rule violation has been rendered prior to the Effective Date, but the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 is still serving the period of 
Ineligibility
 as of the Effective Date, the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 may apply to ADAK or other 
Anti-Doping Organization
 which had 
Results Management
 responsibility for the Anti-Doping rule violation to consider a reduction in the period of 
Ineligibility
 in light of these Anti-Doping Rules. Such application must be made before the period of 
Ineligibility
 has expired. The decision rendered may be appealed pursuant to Article 13.2. These Anti-Doping Rules shall have no application to any case where a final decision finding an Anti-Doping rule violation has been rendered and the period of 
Ineligibility
 has expired.
24.7.5 For purposes of assessing the period of 
Ineligibility
 for a second violation under Article 10.9.1, where the sanction for the first violation was determined based on rules in force prior to the Effective Date, the period of 
Ineligibility
 which would have been assessed for that first violation had these Anti-Doping Rules been applicable, shall be applied.
24.7.6 Changes to the 
Prohibited List
 and 
Technical Documents
 relating to substances or methods on the 
Prohibited List
 shall not, unless they specifically provide otherwise, be applied retroactively. As an exception, however, when a 
Prohibited Substance
 or a 
Prohibited Method
 has been removed from the 
Prohibited List
, an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 currently serving a period of 
Ineligibility
 on account of the formerly 
Prohibited Substance
 or a 
Prohibited Method
 may apply to ADAK or other 
Anti-Doping Organization
 which had 
Results Management
 responsibility for the Anti-Doping rule violation to consider a reduction in the period of

: A report from a 
WADA
-accredited laboratory or other 
WADA
-approved laboratory, that consistent with the 
International Standard
 for Laboratories, establishes in a 
Sample
 the presence of a 
Prohibited Substance
 or its 
Metabolites
 or 
Markers
 or evidence of the 
Use
 of a 
Prohibited Method
.
Adverse Passport Finding
: A report identified as an 
Adverse Passport Finding
 as described in the applicable 
International Standards
.
Aggravating Circumstances
: Circumstances involving, or actions by, an 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 which may justify the imposition of a period of 
Ineligibility
 greater than the standard sanction. Such circumstances and actions shall include, but are not limited to: the

 to commit a violation if the 
Person
 renounces the 
Attempt
 prior to it being discovered by a third party not involved in the 
Attempt
.
Atypical Finding
: A report from a 
WADA

Consequences
, including all steps and processes in between, including but not limited to, 
Testing
, investigations, whereabouts, 
TUEs

, as established by the ruling body of the 
Event
.
Event Venues
: Those venues so designated by the ruling body for the

Fault
:
Fault
 is any breach of duty or any lack of care appropriate to a particular situation. Factors to be taken into consideration in assessing an 
Athlete’s
 or other 
Person’s
 degree of 
Fault
 include, for example, the 
Athlete’s
 or other 
Person’s
 experience, whether the 
Athlete
 or other 
Person
 is a 
Protected Person
,special considerations such as impairment, the degree of risk that should have been perceived by the 
Athlete
 and the level of care and investigation exercised by the 
Athlete
 in relation to what should have been the perceived level of risk.
In assessing the 
Athlete's
 or other 
Person's
 degree of 
Fault
, the circumstances considered must be specific and relevant to explain the 
Athlete’s
 or other 
Person’s
 departure from the expected standard of behavior. Thus, for example, the fact that an 
Athlete
 would lose the opportunity to earn large sums of money during a period of 
Ineligibility
 or the fact that the 
Athlete
 only has a short time left in a career or the timing of the sporting calendar, would not be relevant factors to be considered in reducing the period of 
Ineligibility
 under Article 10.6.1 or 10.6.2.
