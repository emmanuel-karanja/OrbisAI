2. Interpretation
In these Rules, unless the context otherwise requires—
"advocate" means a person who has the right of audience before the Court under rule 25 of the Court of Appeal Rules (sub. leg);
"appeal" means an appeal from the decision of the High Court;
"Commission" means the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission established under Article 88 of the Constitution;
"Court" means the Court of Appeal;
"judge" means a judge of the Court;
"notice of appeal" means notice lodged in accordance with rule 6;
"notice of cross-appeal" means a notice lodged in accordance with rule 10 (4);
"Registrar"means the Registrar of the Court and includes a deputy registrar;
"registry" means the registry of the Court and includes a sub-registry; and
"respondent" includes any person on whom a notice of appeal has been served and any person other than the appellant on whom a notice of cross-appeal has been served.
3. Object
The object of these Rules is to facilitate the just, expeditious and impartial determination of election petition appeals in exercise of the Court's appellate jurisdiction under Article 164 (3) of the Constitution.
4. Application
(1)
These Rules apply to the conduct of appeals from decisions of the High Court in election petitions and matters relating thereto.
(2)
Where there is no applicable provision in these Rules, the provisions of the Court of Appeal Rules (sub. leg) relating to civil appeals shall apply to an election petition appeal in so far as they are not inconsistent with these Rules.
(3)
Where there is a conflict between these Rules and the Court of Appeal Rules (sub. leg) on matters relating to election petition appeals, the provisions of these Rules shall prevail.
(4)
A decision of the Court that a provision of one set of Rules prevails over another provision does not invalidate the latter provision, but the latter provision shall be inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency.
5. Non-compliance with Rules
The effect of any failure to comply with these Rules shall be a matter for determination at the Court's discretion subject to the provisions of Article 159 (2)(d) of the Constitution and the need to observe the timelines set by the Constitution or any other electoral law.

24. Recess and leave
The President of the Court shall, in consultation with the Chief Justice, schedule the recess and terms of leave for the judges of the Court in a manner that ensures that no Court recess or leave coincides with the period within which appeals from petitions relating to a general election are expected to be filed.
25. Prohibition of delayed interlocutory applications
The Court shall not allow any interlocutory application made after the hearing of the appeal has commenced if the interlocutory application could have, by its nature, been brought before the commencement of the hearing.

dismissing the appeal;
