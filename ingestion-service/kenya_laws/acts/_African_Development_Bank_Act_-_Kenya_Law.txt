There shall be charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund without further appropriation than this Act all payments required to be made from time to time by the Government to the Bank under the terms of the Bank Agreement.
(2)
For the purpose of providing any sums required for making payments under this section, the Minister may, on behalf of the Government, make such arrangements as are necessary, or may raise loans by the creation and issue of securities bearing such rates of interest and subject to such conditions as to repayment, redemption or otherwise as he thinks fit, and the principal and interest of such securities and the charges and expenses incurred in connexion with their issue shall be charged on and paid out of the consolidated fund.

PROVISIONS OF THE BANK AGREEMENT WHICH ARE TO HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW IN KENYA
[Section 4]
Article 23 - General Powers
In addition to the powers provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the Bank shall have power to —
(a)
borrow funds in member countries or elsewhere, and in that connexion to furnish such collateral or other security as it shall determine, provided always that—
(i)
before making a sale of its obligations in the market of a member, the Bank shall have obtained its approval;
(ii)
where the obligations of the Bank are to be denominated in the currency of a member, the Bank shall have obtained its approval; and
(iii)
where the funds to be borrowed are to be included in its ordinary capital resources, the Bank shall have obtained, where appropriate, the approval of the members referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph that the proceeds may be exchanged for any other currency without any restrictions;
(b)
buy and sell securities the Bank has issued or guaranteed or in which it has invested, provided always that it shall have obtained the approval of any member in whose territory the securities are to be bought or sold;
(c)
guarantee or underwrite securities in which it has invested in order to facilitate their sale;
(d)
invest funds not needed in its operations in such obligations as it may determine and invest funds held by the Bank for pensions or similar purposes in marketable securities;
(e)
undertake activities incidental to its operations such as, among others, the promotion of consortia for financing which serves the purpose of the Bank and comes within its functions;
(f)
(i)
provide all technical advice and assistance which serve its purpose and come within its functions; and
(ii)
where expenditure incurred by such a service is not reimbursed, charge the net income of the Bank therewith and, in the first five years of its operations, use up to one percent of its paid-up capital on such expenditure; provided always that the total expenditure of the Bank on such services in each year of that period does not exceed one-fifth of that percentage; and
(g)
exercise such other powers as shall be necessary or desirable in furtherance of its purpose and functions, consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
Article 24 - Special Borrowing Powers
(1)
The Bank may request any member to loan amounts of its currency to the Bank in order to finance expenditure in respect of goods or services produced in the territory of that member for the purpose of a project to be carried out in the territory of another member.
(2)
Unless the member concerned invokes economic and financial difficulties which, in its opinion, are likely to be provoked or aggravated by the granting of such a loan to the Bank, that member shall comply with the request of the Bank. The loan shall be made for a period to be agreed with the Bank, which shall be in relation to the duration of the project which the proceeds of that loan are designed to finance.
(3)
Unless the member agrees otherwise, the aggregate amount outstanding in respect of its loans made to the Bank pursuant to this Article shall not, at any time, exceed the equivalent of the amount of its subscription to the capital stock of the Bank.
(4)
Loans to the Bank made pursuant to this Article shall bear interest, payable by the Bank to the lending member, at a rate which shall correspond to the average rate of interest paid by the Bank on its borrowings for Special Funds during a period of one year preceding the conclusion of the loan agreement. This rate shall in no event exceed a maximum rate which the Board of Governors shall determine from time to time.
(5)
The Bank shall repay the loan, and pay the interest due in respect thereof, in the currency of the lending member or in a currency acceptable to the latter.
(6)
All resources obtained by the Bank by virtue of the provisions of this Article shall constitute a Special Fund.

(b)
such currency forms part of the special resources of the Bank and its use is subject to special rules and regulations.

The Bank shall not use gold or currencies which it holds for the purchase of other currencies of its members except—

(b)
pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors adopted by a two-thirds majority of the total voting power of the members.

(1)
Whenever the par value of the currency of a member is reduced in terms of the unit of account defined in paragraph (1) (b) of Article 5 of this Agreement, or its foreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Bank, depreciated to a significant extent, that member shall pay to the Bank within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value of all such currency held by the Bank, excepting currency derived by the Bank from its borrowing.
(2)
Whenever the par value of the currency of a member is increased in terms of the said unit of account, or its foreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Bank, appreciated to a significant extent, the Bank shall pay to that member within a reasonable time an amount of that currency required to adjust the value of all such currency held by the Bank, excepting currency derived by the Bank from its borrowing.
(3)
The Bank may waive the provisions of this Article where a uniform proportionate change in the par value of the currencies of all its members takes place.

Article 52 - Position of Bank with Regard to Judicial Proceedings
(1)
The Bank shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except in cases arising out of the exercise of its borrowing powers when it may be sued only in a court of competent jurisdiction in the territory of a member in which the Bank has its principal office, or in the territory of a member or non-member State where it has appointed an agent for the purpose of accepting service or notice of process or has issued or guaranteed securities. No actions shall, however, be brought by members or persons acting for or deriving claims from members.

shall be immune from legal process with respect to acts performed by them in their official capacity;

(i)
which discriminates against such obligation or security solely because it is issued by the Bank; or

(4)
No tax of any kind shall be levied on any obligation or security guaranteed by the Bank, including any dividend or interest thereon, by whomsoever held—
