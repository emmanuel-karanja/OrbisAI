Any book, newspaper or other thing seized under this section shall be brought as soon as practicable before a magistrate, who may, if he is satisfied that the book or newspaper was printed or published in contravention of this Act or any rules thereunder, or that such other thing has been used in the commission of an offence under this Act or any rules thereunder, order that it be forfeited or destroyed.
