upon repayment of the loan and all interest due on it, give written notice of the repayment to the land registrar, who shall register it against the title to the borrower’s land and cancel any memorandum of the loan which is endorsed on the grant or certificate of title, and thereupon the charge created in respect of the loan shall be extinguished,

22. Consent by trustee to short-term loan
If a trustee consents to his security being postponed to enable a loan to be made, his consent shall not itself be deemed improper or a breach of trust so as to render the trustee liable in respect of any loss resulting from the loan having been made.
23. Loan to co-operative society
(1)
The Corporation may make a loan to any cooperative society primarily engaged in agriculture to enable the society to erect buildings, install equipment or buy land or otherwise to promote any one or more of the objects of the society—

(c)
upon the society lodging with its application a list of the persons who were members of the society at the time of the resolution; and
(d)
upon the Board being satisfied that the accounts, books, papers, and documents of the society are in order; and
(e)
upon such security (if any) as the Board may require; and
(f)
upon the authority of a resolution of a meeting of the Board at which the application is properly considered and approved.
(2)
The Commissioner for Co-operative Development shall, at the request of the Board, furnish such lists and other information as the Board may require regarding any co-operative society.
24. Examination of books of co-operative society
The Board shall at all times have full access to all accounts, books, papers and documents of any co-operative society to which a loan has been made or from which an application for a loan has been received, and may cause all such accounts, documents, papers or books to be examined by a member of the staff or by such other person as the Board may appoint.
25. Liability of members of co-operative society
(1)
Where a loan is made to a co-operative society, all persons who were members of the society at the time of the application for the loan and are named in the list referred to in 
section 23

(2)
If a person who was a member of a co-operative society at the time of the application for a loan and is named in the list referred to in 
section 23
(1)(c) ceases to be a member of that society, he shall nevertheless remain liable under subsection (1) of this section in respect of any part of a loan and any interest which was outstanding at the time he ceased to be a member, and on ceasing to be a member he shall provide security to the satisfaction of the Board for the due discharge of that liability.
(3)
Where a co-operative society is a company registered under the Companies Act (Cap. 486), the liability of the shareholders of the company is limited to the amount (if any) of the share capital not called up, and subsection (2) of this section shall not apply to a person who has ceased to be a shareholder in the company.
Part IV – GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO LOANS
26. Rate of interest, and form of security
(1)
A loan shall bear such rate of interest as the Board with the approval of the Cabinet Secretary for the time being responsible for finance given after consultation with the Cabinet Secretary, may prescribe, either generally or for any particular class of loan.
(2)
A mortgage given under this Act shall be in such form as is prescribed under any written law relating to that mortgage or, where no such form is prescribed, in such form as the Board may determine.
27. Appraisal of land offered as security
The Board, if it considers it desirable, shall cause land offered as security for a loan to be appraised by an appraiser, and in such case the appraiser shall render to the Corporation an appraisal of the land in a form approved by the Board.
28. Waiver of priority
Any mortgagee may, by waiver endorsed upon or incorporated in the mortgage, agree that a mortgage in favour of the Corporation shall have priority, either for the purposes of this Part or for any of the other purposes of this Act, over his mortgage, and such agreement when registered in the same manner as the mortgage held by him shall for all purposes be binding upon him and as from the date of registration upon his successors in title.
29. Loan to be taken up within three months
If a loan has been authorized by the Board and the applicant does not, within a period to be fixed by the Corporation (but not exceeding three months after the applicant has been notified of the authorization), execute such documents as the Board may consider necessary to complete the security and lodge them with the Corporation together with the title deeds of and other documents relative to the applicant’s title to the property (if it is to be mortgaged), the Board may withdraw its authorization of the loan, and in that event the loan shall not be made and no part of the fees paid in connexion with the application shall be refunded.
30. Covenants and conditions to be implied in mortgages
(1)
In every mortgage or other security document executed to secure a loan, there shall be implied on the part of the farmer and in favour of the Corporation the covenants and conditions set out in the Schedule to this Act.
(2)
All such covenants and conditions shall extend to and bind the successor in title of the mortgagor.
31. Corporation may withhold loan where debtor in default
If a loan is made and—
(a)
at any time any sum of money, whether principal or interest, due in respect of the loan is unpaid; or
(b)
the Board considers that the loan has not been applied to the purposes for which it was made or has not been carefully and economically expended; or
(c)
the debtor becomes insolvent, or is sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine, or conveys or assigns his property for the benefit of his creditors generally, or makes a composition or arrangement with his creditors, or (the debtor having died) his estate is or is about to be administered in bankruptcy; or
(d)
there has been a breach of any other condition of the loan; or
(e)
the loan is not applied within such time as the Corporation may consider reasonable to the purpose for which it was made,
the Corporation may in addition to any other remedies refuse to pay any portion of the loan which has been approved but not yet paid.
32. Application of money repaid prematurely
(1)
If a person to whom a loan has been made under this Act (in this section referred to as a borrower) at any time pays to the Corporation an amount in excess of the instalment then due under the mortgage, the Corporation may, if it thinks fit, on the date when the next instalment falls due, apply such amount in payment of the capital portion of one or more of the instalments which would otherwise thereafter fall due, and the instalments may then be recalculated on the basis of balance of capital owing by the borrower over the remainder of the period for which the loan was originally made.
(2)
Such an excess payment, and its application by the Corporation as provided in subsection (1) of this section, shall not exempt the borrower from paying his next instalment when it is due, reduced or recalculated where appropriate.
(3)
The Corporation may allow a borrower a rebate of interest, in respect of money paid prematurely, and the rebate shall be in the form of a reduction of the rate of interest charged on that money by one per cent per annum from the date of the payment up to the date when the next instalment falls due.
(4)
If the total amount owing to the Corporation is paid off before the due date for payment, the Corporation may claim interest only up to the date of payment:
Provided that, in the case of repayment on a date before the due date for repayment, three months’ notice of intention to repay shall be given to the Corporation, and if no such notice is given the Corporation may claim interest in respect of such amount for the period by which the notice actually given falls short of three months.
33. Procedure for recovery on default by occupation or sale of property
(1)
In any of the circumstances or events mentioned in 
section 31
 of this Act, the Corporation may, by notice served on the person to whom the loan has been made or his personal representative (in this section referred to as the debtor) personally or by post, demand repayment of the loan and, after due notice of such demand has been served in similar manner on all subsequent mortgagees of the land on the security of which the loan was made, the Corporation may, without recourse to any court, enter upon the land and either take possession of or sell by public auction through a licensed auctioneer the whole or (where subdivision is not prohibited) any part of the land upon such terms and conditions as the Board may in all the circumstances consider proper.
(2)
At a public auction held in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section, the Corporation, by its agent duly authorized in writing, may bid for and purchase the whole or any part of the land offered for sale.
(3)
The Corporation, as agent of the debtor, may transfer the land to itself or any other purchaser and give a good and unencumbered title to it, and may execute all such documents and do all such other acts as may be necessary to complete the transfer.
(4)
A sale under subsection (1) shall not be held until—
(a)
a notice of the sale has been published in the 
Gazette
, or in a newspaper circulating in the area in which the land is situated, stating the date, time and place of the sale, and the terms and conditions of the sale; and
(b)
twenty-one days have elapsed since the date of publication of the notice; and
(c)
all reasonable steps have been taken by the Corporation to notify in writing the persons having a registered interest (or any unregistered interest of which the Corporation knows) in the land of the intended sale.

No. 5 of 1996
, s. 36.]
34. Inspection of land
For the purpose of ascertaining whether a loan has been or is being properly applied, any member of the staff, or any person deputed by the Corporation to inspect land under this Act, may enter upon any land in respect of which the loan was made and make such inspections thereon as he considers proper.
35. Protection against liability
Where a loan is made in good faith, and it is afterwards discovered that—
(a)
the land comprised in any mortgage or other security document in respect of the development of which a loan was granted was not used, or was not used, as the case may be, for agricultural purposes; or
(b)
the loan was not applied for the purpose for which it was made within the time specified by the Board, or the loan was applied for purposes other than that for which it was made,
no Director and no member of the staff shall be personally liable therefore, but—
(i)
the Board or the General Manager may refuse to pay any part of the loan which has not already been paid; and
(ii)
the Board may at once proceed to call in and recover the money already lent.
