Part I – PRELIMINARY
1. Citation
These Regulations may be cited as the Biosafety (Environmental Release) Regulations.
2. Interpretation
In these Regulations unless the context otherwise requires—
"applicant" means a person making an application under to these Regulations;
"Authority" means the National Biosafety Authority established under section 5 of the Act;
"Biosafety Clearing-House" means a mechanism for exchange of scientific, technical, environmental, socio-economic and legal information and experience with genetically modified organisms;
"environmental release" means introduction into the environment of a genetically modified organism for which an approval has been granted in accordance with these Regulations and—
(a)
for which no specific containment measures are used to limit their contact with and to provide a high level of safety for the general population and the environment; and
(b)
includes making genetically modified organisms available to the public for purposes other than sale;
"genetically modified organism" means an organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology techniques;
"placing on the market" means making a genetically modified organism available for sale;
"regulatory agency" means a regulatory agency as set out in the First Schedule to the Act, or such other agency as the Minister may, by order in the Gazette, determine;
"risk assessment" means the evaluation of risks to human and the environment, whether direct or indirect, immediate or delayed, which the environmental release or placing on the market of genetically modified organisms may pose;
"screening for completeness" means the evaluation of an application to ensure that all the administrative as well as technical requirements are met.
3. Objective
The objective of these Regulations is to ensure that potential adverse effects of genetically modified organisms are addressed to protect human health and the environment when conducting environmental release.
4. Exceptions
These Regulations shall not apply to genetically modified organisms that are pharmaceuticals for human use.
Part II – APPLICATIONS
5. Environmental release
(1)
A person shall not make an environmental release without the written approval of the Authority.
(2)
An application for environmental release shall be made to the Authority in the form set out in Part A of the First Schedule to these Regulations and shall be accompanied by—
(a)
an application fee of Kenya shillings eight hundred and fifty thousand; and
(b)
where necessary, an additional risk assessment report.
(3)
An applicant may—
(a)
refer to data or results from an application previously submitted by another applicant; or
(b)
submit additional information that the applicant considers relevant, provided that the information, data and results are non-confidential or such applicants have given their agreement in writing.
(4)
The Authority may allow an application for release of the same genetically modified organism on the same site or on different sites for the same purpose and within a definite period to be made in a single application.
(5)
Where the Authority, after a risk assessment, considers that it is necessary for the genetically modified organism to be subjected to contained use, the Authority shall communicate its decision to the applicant in writing and the provisions of the Contained Use Regulations shall apply.
(6)
Where the application is for introduction into the environment of a genetically modified organism that is not locally developed, the Authority, after a risk assessment, may require that the applicant carries out field trials of the genetically modified organism and the provisions of the Contained Use Regulations shall apply.
(7)
A person who contravenes sub-regulation (1) commits an offence.
6. Placing on the market
(1)
A person shall not place on the market a genetically modified organism without the written approval of the Authority.
(2)
An application to place on the market a genetically modified organism shall be made to the Authority in the form set out in Part B of the First Schedule to these Regulations and shall be accompanied by—
(a)
an application fee of Kenya shillings eight hundred and fifty thousand; and
(b)
where necessary, a risk assessment report.
(3)
An applicant may—
(a)
refer to data or results from an application previously submitted by other applicants; or
(b)
submit additional information that the applicant considers relevant, provided that the information, data and results are non-confidential or such applicants have given their agreement in writing.
(4)
A person who contravenes subregulation (1) commits an offence.
7. Consideration of an application
(1)
Upon receiving an application, the Authority shall within fourteen days screen for completeness and circulate to the relevant regulatory agencies for further information, comments or reasoned objections.
(2)
The Authority shall in considering an application, examine—
(a)
the conformity of an application with the requirements of these Regulations;
(b)
the accuracy and completeness of the information given;

The authority shall publicize an application received hereunder and invite written comments from members of the public within twenty one days.
(4)
Where necessary, the Authority may ask an applicant to provide further information.
(5)
The Authority shall communicate its final decision to the applicant within one hundred and fifty days of receipt of the application, but not earlier than ninety days of such receipt.
(6)
For the purpose of calculating the periods, any period of time during which the Authority is awaiting any further information that it may have requested from the applicant shall not be taken into account.
8. Non-assessment of risks
(1)
The Authority may opt not to undertake risk assessment where it determines that sufficient experience or information exists to conclude that an environmental release does not pose a significant risk.
(2)
Once an approval has been granted by the Authority for release of a genetically modified organism, subsequent release of the same species, or the same species modified with the same gene or combination of genes, may be exempted from risk assessment.
9. Approval
(1)
An approval for environmental release shall be in the Form set out in the Second schedule to these Regulations.
(2)
If information becomes available that an approved activity poses a risk to human health or the environment, the Authority may amend or revoke the approval.
10. Validity and renewal of approval
(1)
An approval granted under these Regulations shall be for a period not exceeding ten years.
(2)
At least nine months before the expiry of an approval period, a person intending to continue to release into the environment or placing genetically modified organisms on the market shall submit an application for the renewal of the approval.
(3)
An application for renewal of an approval under these Regulations shall contain the information set out in the First Schedule to these Regulations and shall be accompanied by—
(a)
an application fee of eight hundred and fifty thousand shillings;
(b)
a copy of the approval under regulation 9(1);
(c)
a report on the results of the monitoring which was carried out in accordance with these Regulations;
(d)
any new information which has become available with regard to the risks of the genetically modified organism to human health and the environment; and
(e)

(6)
An approval for renewal from the Authority shall be valid for a period of ten years.
(7)
Where a genetically modified organism has been released into the environment or placed on the market for twenty years with the approval from the Authority, and the Authority establishes that monitoring data indicates no risk to human health and the environment, the genetically modified organism may continue to be released to the environment or placed on the market without further approval.
11. Handling of new information
