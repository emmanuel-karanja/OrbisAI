In exercising this judgment, a professional accountant in public practice should consider what a reasonable and informed third party, having knowledge of all relevant information, including the significance of the threat and the safeguards applied, would reasonably conclude to be acceptable.
20.
This consideration will be affected by matters such as the significance of the threat, the nature of the engagement and the structure of the firm.
B. PROFESSIONAL APPOINTMENT
21.
Client Acceptance —
(1)
Before accepting a new client relationship, a professional accountant in public practice shall consider whether acceptance would create any threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.
(2)
Potential threats to integrity or professional behaviour may be created from, for example, questionable issues associated with the client (its owners, management and activities).
(3)
Appropriate safeguards may include obtaining knowledge and understanding of the client, its owners, managers and those responsible for its governance and business activities, or securing the client’s commitment to improve corporate governance practices or internal controls.
C. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
22.
(1) A professional accountant in public practice shall take reasonable steps to identify circumstances that could pose a conflict of interest.
(2)
Such circumstances may give rise to threats to compliance with the fundamental principles for instance, a threat to objectivity may be created when a professional accountant in public practice competes directly with a client or has a joint venture or similar arrangement with a major competitor of a client and thereafter evaluate any threats that may rise.
(3)
Depending therefore on the circumstances giving rise the conflict, safeguards should ordinarily include the professional accountant in public practice —
(a)
notifying the client of the firm’s business interest or activities that may represent a conflict of interest, and obtaining their consent to act in such circumstances; or
(b)
notifying all known relevant parties that the professional accountant in public practice is acting for two or more parties in respect of a matter where their respective interests are in conflict, and obtaining their consent to so act; or
(c)
notifying the client that the professional accountant in public practice does not act exclusively for any one client in the provision of proposed services for example, in a particular market sector or with respect to a specific service and obtaining their consent to so act.
23. Where a conflict of interest poses a threat to one or more of the fundamental principles, including objectivity, confidentiality or professional behaviour that cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level through the application of safeguards, the professional accountant in public practice should conclude that it is not appropriate to accept a specific engagement or that resignation from one or more conflicting engagements is required.
D. SECOND OPINIONS
24. Occurs in a situation where a professional accountant in public practice is asked to provide a second opinion on the application of accounting, auditing, reporting or other standards or principles to specific circumstances or transactions by or on behalf of a company or an entity that is not an existing client which may give rise to threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.
25. The significance of the threat in this case will depend on the circumstances of the request and all the other available facts and assumptions relevant to the expression of a professional judgment.
E. FEES AND OTHER TYPES OF REMUNERATION
26. When entering into negotiations regarding professional services, a professional accountant in public practice may quote a fee that he or she deems appropriate.
27. A professional accountant in public practice who quotes a fee lower than another is not unethical but there may be threats to compliance with the fundamental principles arising from the level of fees quoted for instance, a self interest threat to professional competence and due care is created if the fee quoted is so low that it may be difficult to perform the engagement in accordance with applicable technical and professional standards for that price.
28. The significance of the threats will depend on factors such as the level of fee quoted and the services to which it applies.
29. In view of these potential threats, safeguards should be considered and applied as necessary to eliminate them or reduce them to an acceptable level.
30. Safeguards that may be adopted include —
(a)
making the client aware of the terms of the engagement and, in particular, the basis on which fees are charged and which services are covered by the quoted fee;
(b)
assigning appropriate time and qualified staff to the task.
31. A professional accountant in public practice may also pay a referral fee to obtain a client, for example, where the client continues as a client of another professional accountant in public practice but requires specialist services not offered by the existing accountant.
32. The payment of such a referral fee may also create a self-interest threat to objectivity and professional competence and due care.
33. A professional accountant in public practice shall not pay or receive a referral fee or commission, unless the professional accountant in public practice has established safeguards to eliminate the threats or reduce them to an acceptable level.
34. Such safeguards may include —
(a)
disclosing to the client any arrangements to pay a referral fee to another professional accountant for the work referred;
(b)
disclosing to the client any arrangements to receive a referral fee for referring the client to another professional accountant in public practice;
(c)
obtaining advance agreement from the client for commission arrangements in connection with the sale by a third party of goods or services to the client.
F. MARKETING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
35. When a professional accountant in public practice solicits new work through advertising or other forms of marketing, there may be potential threats to compliance with the fundamental principles.
36. A professional accountant in public practice should not bring the profession into disrepute when marketing professional services.
37. The professional accountant in public practice shall be honest and truthful and shall not —
(a)
make exaggerated claims for services offers, qualifications possessed or experience gained; or
(b)
make disparaging references to unsubstantiated comparisons to the work of another.
38. If the professional accountant in public practice is in doubt whether a proposed form of advertising or marketing is appropriate, the professional accountant in public practice should consult with the relevant professional body.
G. CUSTODY OF CLIENT ASSETS
39. A professional accountant in public practice shall not assume custody of client monies or other assets unless permitted to do so by law and, if so, in compliance with any additional legal duties imposed on a professional accountant in public practice holding such assets.
40. The holding of client assets creates threats to compliance with the fundamental principles for instance there is a self-interest threat to professional behaviour and may be a self-interest threat to objectivity arising from holding client assets.
41. To safeguard against such threats, a professional accountant in public practice entrusted with money or other assets belonging to others shall —
(a)
keep such assets separately from personal or firm assets;
(b)
use such assets only for the purpose for which they are intended;
(c)
at all times, be ready to account for those assets, and any income, dividends or gains generated, to any persons entitled to such accounting; and
(d)
comply with all relevant laws and regulations relevant to the holding of and accounting for such assets.
H. OBJECTIVITY–ALL SERVICES
42. A professional accountant in public practice shall when providing any professional services consider whether there are threats to compliance with the fundamental principle of objectivity resulting from having interests in, or relationships with, a client or directors, officers or employees.
43. A professional accountant in public practice shall evaluate the significance of identified threats and, if they are other than clearly insignificant, safeguards shall be considered and applied as necessary to eliminate them or reduce them to an acceptable level.
44. Such safeguards may include —
(a)
withdrawing from the engagement team;
(b)
supervisory procedures;
(c)
terminating the financial or business relationship giving rise to the threat;
(d)
discussing the issue with higher levels of management within the firm;
(e)
discussing the issue with those charged with governance of the client.
 
 
 
 
 
 
I. INDEPENDENCE–ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENTS
45. In the case of an assurance engagement, it is in the public interest and, therefore, required by the Code of Ethics, that members of assurance teams, firms and, when applicable, network firms be independent of assurance clients.
46. Assurance engagements are designed to enhance intended users’ degree of confidence about the outcome of the evaluation or measurement of a subject matter against criteria.
47. The International Framework for Assurance Engagements (the Assurance Framework) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board describes the elements and objectives of an assurance engagement and identifies engagements to which International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), International Standards on Review Engagements (ISREs) and International Standards on Assurance Engagements (ISAEs) apply.
48. For a description of the elements and objectives of an assurance engagement reference shall be made to the Assurance Framework.
J. OBJECTIVE AND STRUCTURE
49. The objective of this section is to assist firms and members of assurance teams in —
(a)
identifying threats to independence;
(b)
evaluating whether these threats are clearly insignificant; and
(c)
in cases when the threats are not clearly insignificant, identifying and applying appropriate safeguards to eliminate or reduce the threats to an acceptable level.
50. It is important to consider what a reasonable and informed third party having knowledge of all relevant information; including safeguards applied would reasonably conclude to be unacceptable.
51. In situations when no safeguards are available to reduce the threat to an acceptable level, the only possible actions are to compromise, eliminate the activities or interest creating the threat, or to refuse to accept or continue the assurance engagement.
52. When threats to independence that are not clearly insignificant are identified, and the firm decides to accept or continue the assurance engagement, the decision shall be documented.
53. The documentation shall include a description of the threats identified and the safeguards applied to eliminate or reduce the threats to an acceptable level.
54. Firms should establish policies and procedures relating to independence, communications with audit committees or others charged with governance of the client.
55. In the case of the financial statement audit of listed entities, the firm shall communicate orally and in writing at least annually, all relationships and other matters between the firm, network firms and the financial statement audit client that in the firm’s professional judgment may reasonably be thought to bear on independence.
K. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL ASSURANCE CLIENTS
56. If a member of the assurance team, or their immediate family member, has a direct financial interest, or a material indirect financial interest, in the assurance client, the self-interest threat created would be so significant that the only safeguards available to eliminate the threat or reduce it to an acceptable level would be to —
(a)
dispose of the direct financial interest prior to the individual becoming a member of the assurance team;
(b)
dispose of the indirect financial interest in total;
(c)
dispose of a sufficient amount of it so that the remaining interest is no longer material prior to the individual becoming a member of the assurance team; or
(d)
remove the member of the assurance team from the assurance engagement.
L. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT CLIENTS
57. If a firm, or a network firm, has a direct financial interest in a financial statement audit client of the firm the self-interest threat created would be so significant no safeguard could reduce the threat to an acceptable level.
58. Consequently, the disposal of the financial interest would be the only action appropriate to permit the firm to perform the engagement.
M. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT ASSURANCE CLIENTS
59. If a firm has a direct financial interest in an assurance client that is not a financial statement audit client the self-interest threat created would be so significant no safeguard could reduce the threat to an acceptable level.
60. Consequently, disposal of the financial interest would be the only action appropriate to permit the firm to perform the engagement.
N. FEES AND PRICING FEES–RELATIVE
61. When the fees generated by an assurance client represents a large proportion of a firm’s total fees, the dependence total on that client or client group and concern about the possibility of losing the client may create a self-interest threat.
62. The significance of the threat will depend upon on; the structure of the firm and whether the firm is well established or newly created. Such safeguards for the threats might include —
(a)
discussing the extent and nature of fees charged with the audit committee, or others charged with governance;
(b)
taking steps to reduce dependency on the client;
(c)
external quality control reviews; and
(d)
consulting a third party, such as a professional regulatory body or another professional accountant.
Part III – PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN BUSINESS OR PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS IN COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, EMPLOYMENT AND PUBLIC SECTORS
63. This Part provides how the conceptual framework is applied by professional accountants in business.
64. A professional accountant in business has a responsibility to further the legitimate aims of their employing organization.
65. This Code does not seek to hinder a professional accountant in business from properly fulfilling that responsibility but considers circumstances in which conflicts may be created with the absolute duty to comply with the fundamental principles.
66. Members in industry, employment, private and public sectors are required to comply with the provisions of the Act including the fundamental principles set out in this Schedule.
A. THREATS AND SAFEGUARDS
67. Compliance with the fundamental principles may potentially be threatened by a broad range of circumstances.
68. The threats fall into the following categories —
(a)
Self-interest;
(b)
Self-review;
(c)
Advocacy;
(d)
Familiarity; and
(e)
Intimidation.
69. Safeguards that may eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the threats faced by professional accountants in business fall into two broad categories —
(a)
Safeguards created by the profession;
(b)
legislation or regulation; and
(c)
safeguards in the work environment.
B. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS
70. A professional accountant in business has a professional obligation to comply with the fundamental principles.
71. There may be times, however, when their responsibilities to an employing organization and the professional obligations to comply with the fundamental principles are in conflict.
72. Ordinarily, a professional accountant in business should support the legitimate and ethical objectives established by the employer and the rules and procedures in support of those objectives.
73. Nevertheless, where compliance with the fundamental principles is threatened, a professional accountant in business must consider a response to the circumstances.
C. PREPARATION AND REPORTING OF INFORMATION
74. Professional accountants in business are often involved in the preparation and reporting of information that may either be made public or used by others inside or outside the employing organization.
75. Such information may include financial or management information.
76. A professional accountant in business should prepare or present such information fairly, honestly and in accordance with relevant professional standards so that the information will be understood in its context.
77. A member in industry, employment, private and public sectors shall prepare and present any financial information fully, honestly, professionally and in accordance with the relevant professional standards as issued and implemented by the Institute or other statutory body from time to time.
78. A member in industry, employment, private and public sectors shall —
(a)
assist the employer to maintain all financial and non-financial information in a manner that describes clearly the true nature of business transaction, assets, liabilities; and
(b)
record entries in a timely and proper manner as required by law and professional standards as issued and implemented by the Institute or other statutory body from time to time.
79. Threats to compliance with the fundamental principles may be created where a professional accountant in business may be pressured to become associated with misleading information or to become associated with misleading information through the actions of others. The significance of these threats will depend on factors such as the source of the pressure and the degree to which the information is, or may be, misleading.
D. INDUCEMENTS
80. A member in industry, employment, private and public sectors shall not receive an inducement in an attempt to unduly influence actions or decisions, encourage illegal or dishonest behavior or illegally obtain confidential information.
81. If there are circumstances that threaten a member in industry, employment, private and public sectors to be involved in receiving inducements, such member shall immediately report to higher levels of management or those in charge of governance of the employing organization.
82. A member in industry, employment, private and public sector shall not offer an inducement to improperly influence professional judgment of a third party.
E. PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE
83. A member in industry, employment, private and public sector shall only undertake significant tasks for which the member has sufficient training and experience and where necessary seek assistance from relevant experts.
84. A member in industry, employment, private or public sector shall not —
(a)
intentionally seek employment without the requisite degree of expertise or experience; or
(b)
intentionally mislead the employer as to the degree of expertise or experience he possesses.
F. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS
85. A member in industry, employment, private or public sector owes a duty to the employer and the profession and shall not —
(a)
act contrary to the law or regulations;
(b)
breach the rules and standards of the accountancy profession;
(c)
intentionally mislead officers acting as auditors to the employer or the Institute;
(d)
be involved in corrupt practices; or
(e)
issue a financial or non-financial report that materially misrepresents facts including but not limited to financial statements, tax compliance, legal compliance or any reports required by regulators or the Institute.
G. COMPLIANCE TO INTERNATIONAL CODE OF ETHICS FOR ACCOUNTANTS
86. A member shall, in addition to the provisions of this Code, comply with the prescribed code of ethics for professional accountants as issued by the International Federation of Accountants through the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants from time to time and any other applicable regulatory international and Institute pronouncements or standards.
